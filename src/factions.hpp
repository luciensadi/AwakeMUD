/* prototype / design: NPCs belong to factions, which matter to players because you can accrue rep with factions.
   - [f] if a faction NPC sees you help their cause, you gain rep
     - [f] killing their enemies can only take you up to Cooperative so folks don't murder-hobo their way into Ally with everyone
     - quests can be flagged as 'ally-worthy', if not flagged as such they can only take you up to Friendly. No being an ally by endlessly running packages

   - [i] if a faction NPC sees you attack / kill someone on their side, you lose rep
   - [i] if they can't see you (invis etc, or firing from outside of their vision range), they don't report in about you

   - [√] FACTION LIST
   -    [i] as a low-level builder who can't see them all
   - [√] FACTION SHOW x
   - [√] FACTION EDIT x
   - [√] FACTION CREATE
   - [p] FACTION SETREP ch x y
   - [p] FACTION DELETE x

  Why this matters to players:
  - [i] Low rep gets you attacked on sight by faction guards and puts faction non-guard NPCs on alert when they see you
  - [i] Discount / surcharge that scales on rep with the store owner's faction, refusal to sell on Hostile
  - [√] Bouncers that don't let you pass without certain faction status ratings.
  - High rep gets you access to more jobs with them?

  STRETCH:
  - Factions have leaders. When a leader NPC is killed, they don't leave a corpse, and instead are "docwagoned" like a PC using zone-appropriate messaging before being extracted to enable respawn.
  - Attacking the leader is bad and gets you a big rep penalty.
  - You can buy faction rep up to Friendly by paying the leader. No, you can't get your money back by then killing the leader.
  - High rep ratings get you occasional upnods and recognition in passing. Low ones get you scowls and threatening moves from non-wimpy chars.
  - if you're disguised somehow (figure this out), NPCs don't report in unless they see through the disguise (perception check?)
  - Hosts belong to factions, and if they trace you back, you lose a lot of rep.
  - Failing a quest loses rep

  SUPER STRETCH:
  - Figure out a way for players to see which faction an NPC belongs to that doesn't completely break immersion
  - Faction shops can have goods available at different rep levels (no buying X until ally)
  - Wimpy faction mobs flee when a hostile-rep player shows up.
  - Rooms can be flagged as no-trespassing with a severity rating. If you're caught in one, you get a faction rep penalty (w/ cooldown) and may be attacked.
  - Doing harmful quests can lower the opposing faction's view of you (e.g. raid Mitsu on a job, Mitsu's rep goes down)

KEY: 
- p: prototyped
- f: implemented in faction code, but not rolled out to rest of codebase
- i: implemented in whole codebase / ready for testing
- √: tested / done

// √ Figure out how to show builders factions in their zones when they haven't met them yet. [staff must set rep? Or editor list]
// √ If editor list, then: FACTION CREATE makes you an editor of it; you always have view permissions for it.
// √ Save/load mob faction affiliation.

// TODO: Staff can set PC's faction rep
// TODO: Non-editors of protected zones can't see factions from protected zones
// STRETCH: Allow lower-level builders to edit them
// STRETCH: Jobs can have faction rep impacts on other factions (e.g. "steal this thing from Mitsuhama", giver is pleased, mitsu is not)

// TODO: Ensure that you only get the witness penalty from hitting someone once per combat
