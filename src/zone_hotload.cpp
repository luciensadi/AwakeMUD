/*
  To lower the amount of iteration we need to do on mobs/objects/etc, we will be
unloading zones that aren't in use.

  1) Track the last time any player was in a given zone. A simple hook on
from_room and to_room to set a timestamp works here. 2) Once a zone goes unused
for a length of time X, unload all mobs and items in the zone EXCEPT FOR:
     - player corpses
     - quest-flagged things
     - anything in an apartment or storage room
     - anything with a player drop record on it (the code will handle this
separately) 3) Pause zoneloading / resetting / mobact for this zone.

  Then, when a player enters the zone:
  1) Hook into char_to_room. When you're about to enter an offloaded zone, loop
the following Y times:
     - run resets
     - run mobact Z times.
  2) Cleanup any corpses generated during the above process.

  TODO: Investigate how many "load once at game start, then never again" things
we have zoneloading. Probably convert all of these to limited-cap loads.
  TODO: When someone rigs or unrigs a vehicle, check to make sure the zone is
loaded, and populate it if it isn't.
  TODO: Set zone last action timer any time a command is run in the zone


notes for handler changes:
ADD to the zone's amount when:
√ a player or possessed npc enters a room in the zone
√ a player or possessed npc is physically added to a vehicle in the zone
√ a player is virtually added to a vehicle in the zone (remote rigging)
√ a vehicle containing a player enters a room in
√ a staffer possesses an NPC in the zone

REMOVE from the zone's amount when:
√ a player or possessed npc leaves a room in the zone
√ a player or possessed npc physically leaves a vehicle in the zone
√ a player virtually leaves a vehicle in the zone
√ a vehicle containing one or more players leaves a room in the zone
√ a staffer unpossesses an NPC in the zone

ADD to the vehicle's amount when:
√ a staffer possesses an NPC in the veh
√ a player or possessed npc physically enters
√ a player virtually enters

REMOVE from the vehicle's amount when:
√ a staffer unpossesses an NPC in the veh
√ a player or possessed npc physically leaves
√ a player virtually leaves
