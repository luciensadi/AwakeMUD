/* I'm going to regret doing this, aren't I?

  PETS are objects that wander when placed in an apartment.
  - made with CREATE PET like art; customize it and pay XX syspoints
    - name, shortdesc, room desc
    - which set of premade echoes you want it to use
  - cannot be dropped outside of apartments, but can be held
  - moves slowly around the apartment, will not leave (gag with movegag)
  - does environmental echoes rarely

  STRETCH: It moves around. Means you have to do saving etc of apartments on a somewhat regular basis. Think it through.

  STRETCH / v2: custom echoes
  - premade echoes are an unordered map: there's an idnum for the echo set, a name, an author idnum, a private y/n toggle, and a vector of echo messages
  - you can create a new set of echoes for XXX sysp, and specify if only you can work with them, or if they're public for use (private costs more)
  - you can edit your echoes for X sysp
