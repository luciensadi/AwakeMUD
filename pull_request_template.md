Thanks for submitting code! It's highly recommended that you discuss changes / new features with Lucien before merging, so if you haven't done that already, please reach out to him in Discord.

Please include in this PR a description of what your code changes (e.g. "Colors all magazines bright purple for easier locating in inventory lists") or what it's intended to do. The more descriptive you can be, the easier it will be for us to review your code!
