In their past, they\nlearned their skills, their abilities, their loves, their hates, and their\nvirtues (or lack thereof).  Some learned magic, some learned combat, some learned\ntechnology and other skills.  Backgrounds are considered \"living\" as they change\nas the character develops.  In-game events can cause a person to change their\noutlook on things.  These events should be placed in the characters\' backgrounds.\n\n        To really gain the most out of a roleplaying environment, players should\nflesh out their characters.  This helps bring the characters to life, and gets\naway from the numbers and mechanics of the game.  Ask yourself these questions,\nand jot them down on a piece of paper, or your favorite text editor/word\nprocessor, and use them to enhance roleplaying for you and others.\n\n1. What is your character\'s sex?\n2. What is your character\'s physical size?  Is he a short scrawny ork, or a tall\nthin dwarf, or just average?\n3. What is the color of your character\'s hair, eyes, and skin?  There are natural\ncolors, and there are augmented colors.  Cosmetic enhancements are commonplace in\n2064, so take note of that.\n4. What is the character\'s general appearance?\n5. Where was the character born?  Growing up in Seattle results in different\nexperiences and outlooks than being born in Tir Tairngire or NAN tribal lands.\n6. How old is the character?  Characters should be at a minimum of 15 years old\nbefore they start shadowrunning.  There are some rare exceptions to this, so if\nyou have a reason for younger characters elaborate greatly.\n7. What was or is your character\'s family?  What did your character\'s parents do?\nWere they married, divorced, separated, etc?  Does the character have brothers and\nor sisters?\n8. Has the character started his or her own family?  Does your character have\nchildren?\n9. Where and how was your character educated?  The streets?  In a gang?  At a\nuniversity?  In a megacorp?\n10. What does your character do for a living?  Shadowrunning may not be the only\njob, there are other ways to make additional income.\n11. What are your character\'s political, spiritual, or religious beliefs?\nPolitical alliances in 2064 are important to success.  Who do you ally with?\n12. What is your character\'s moral code?  Will he or she kill?  Will he or she\nkill anyone?  Will he or she kill anytime?  Does killing bother him or her?  Does\nyour character have a conscious?  If so, to what extent?\n13. Does your character have any long term goals?  (in-char goals -- not maxxing\nstats, etc. ;-) )  Will he or she accomplish these goals above all else?  Does\nyour character have other agendas?\n14. Why does your character run the shadows?  Does he or she like this lifestyle?\nDoes she or he do it for necessity or enjoyment?\n15. What is your character\'s personality?  Is he or she optimistic, pessimistic,\nsarcastic, a loner, a gung-ho militant, obsessive, rational, passionate,\npatriotic, idealistic, artistic, etc?\n16. What special qualities does your character possess?  Does he or she plan\neverything?  Is he or she patient?  Does he or she have good financial or business\nsense?  Is your character a natural athlete?  Does your character have a knack for\ntechology or science?\n17. Are there things your character cannot do?  A common example, Harlequin may be\na very powerful mage, but he can not seem to get a simple radio to work.\n18. Does your character have hates?  Do they hate megacorps, metahumans, laziness,\nobesity, politics, religion, BTL addicts, drunks, etc?\nNote: Racism in 2064 generally applies to race, not skin color.  There are\nexceptions to this, however.  Some NAN tribespeople hate white (anglo) people, and\nin Tsimshian territory there is a great deal of hatred between the Tsimshian and\nHaida tribes.\n19. What does your character love?  Do they love drinking, music, members of the\nopposite sex, members of the same sex, shadowrunning, excitement, poetry, reading,\netc?\n20. What is your character\'s birth name?  Does your charracter have a birth right?\nDoes your character know his true name?\n\nA few more questions you may want to answer:\n\n1. What is your character\'s color?\n2. Under what circumstances would your character sacrifice his or her life?\n3. What is the best thing your character ever did?\n4.

Lone Star may not \nrespect your rights, but they do respect extraterritoriality and \njurisdictions, as they do not want to start a corporate war.\nSINS also play a dominant role in the laws of the world of Shadowrun in \n2064.  If you do not have legal SIN (System Identification Number -- \nkinda like todays Social Security Numbers in the United States) you have \nno rights and do not exist.  Getting a SIN is an easy process as you can \nget them at any government or Lone Star office for a bribe, er I mean fee \n(not having a SIN is a felony offense, neat huh?) and blammo you now have \na legal SIN, and can work, play, and for you shadowy types get weapon \npermits and such.  If you have a criminal SIN you can do very little \nlegally and the cops go out of their way to make your life a living hell.  \nIf you have this problem, perhaps you can hire a decker to \"upgrade\" your \nSIN for you but it won\'t be cheap.  As for the corporate front, remember a \ncorp has legal jurisdiection over any part of its complex, if the law \nbroken is not federal (then it becomes an FBI affair in the UCAS).  So \nmaybe it is legal to walk through Ares Macrotechnology\'s towers with a \nsidearm, but Renraku might geek you on sight for the same thing.  Or \nworse, as corporate punishments do often tend to be worse than UCAS \nsentencing.  You might end up getting 30+ years in a labor camp in some \ngodforsaken hellhole of a country in Africa or Asia, where that corp\'s \npower is absolute.  So to maximise your chances of operating, as a \nshadow of the sprawl, (or shadowrunner if you will), it is well advised to \nkeep a very low profile, keep your gear hidden and stashed until you are \non the run itself.  Punishment in Tir Tairngire is even worse, as the Tir \nis officially a \"constitutional monarchy\" but in truth a dictatorship.\n\nHere are some areas that do not draw too much attention from the Lone \nStar, that are within the UCAS territory of Seattle:\n\nPuyallup Barrens\nRedmond Barrens\nTarislar\nOrk Underground\nChinatown\n\nAs you read that list you will realize that they are all dominated by \ngangs, the Mafia, and the Yakuza.  Security types don\'t patrol there very \noften, and tend to take a long time to get there if they show up at all.  \nIf you are being chased by the Star its probably a good idea to lay low in \nthe Barrens or another place similar to it where they don\'t have much of a \npresence.  Places like Downtown Seattle, the Airport, Tacoma, etc are more \nnormalized (less metahuman) so they get more attention from the officials \nto keep out the \"undesirables\".")
