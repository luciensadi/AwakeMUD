Name:	Easy Diver Coffin Motel
Desc:$
   Its a cheap rathole of a coffin motel, with thirty meters of coffins
stacked on top of each other, separated by ladders.  They are painted yellow
with black doors, giving it a yellowjacket-like color, overall. There is a
grimy dirty man playing solitaire at the front desk which is little more than
a metal table with an old PC on it to keep track of customers.

Desc:$
   This rather plain white room is full of clean steel racks upon which with
various items of clothing are hung up in an orderly manner. The little
orange-and-red lettered signs taped to the racks advertise specials such as
"All Underwear, 30% Off" and "Men's Sweatshirts, 20% Off." The floor is plain
white, with silver-speckled linoleum, and appears to have been recently mopped
and waxed.

   On the east side of the road, the high wooden fences split into a muddy
rutted alley dotted with dumpsters, a stray cat idly picking its way around
the puddles.  To the west is the back of a small red brick building, the large
outline of a black dragon in spray paint staring across an empty paved lot
that stretches southwest to the small gas station the next block over, on 5th
street.

   To the west, traffic speeds from Fifth Street, onto Harrison and towards
the onramp, where the tree-lined blocks of houses abruptly come to an end.
Kids are running around towards the eastern end of the street, obviously with
orders from their parents to avoid the turn off. A large green metal sign,
nearly hidden by a mass of rosebushes and looking very out of place among the
trees and gardens, advertises the onramp link to Intercity 5.

Desc:$
   North Ninth runs northward towards the Aztechnology Pyramid and Magic
Academy complex, and southwards towards an onramp to Intercity 90, and the
southeast district where Renraku Arcology and Seattle Center are located.  As
far as media bombardment goes, this intersection puts Times Square to shame,
with vast trideo full-motion billboards advertising every product imaginable
at every hour.  Large groups of people cross the streets at regular intervals,
and wait at other times.  A sign is up on top of the streetlight apparatus,
saying in green, ^GJunction I-90, 1/2 km south^n.

to the workers in this area.  A branch bank is north of here, with an ATM

   Espanoza Way ends a half a block east of here, where it runs into Tenth,
the edge of the northwest sector.  The street is lined with tall prefab
buildings of a dull gray concrete color, with very dull rectangular windows in
a predictible pattern.  Inside the windows you can see bored office workers,
just pretending to do their jobs.  On the lower levels, there are storefronts
selling mostly foreign foods of obscure varieties, from Moroccan to Romanian.
The air is clogged with smog, and very few would run around these streets
without their breathers on, unless they got the constitution of Hercules
post-goblinization, or want to live a very short life.

   Only a few homes can be found in this portion of the street. Tall grey
plasticrete walls shelter this residental zone from the roar of traffic on the
highway; a break in the wall allows entrance to the onramp to I-5. The wall is
spotlessly clean, and free from all graffiti, and the sidewalks have been
decorated with crudely-drawn chalk portraits of flowers and suns, probably the
work of children. A small park with a few benches and a memorial stone sits in
the cul-de-sac that marks the end of Highland Drive.

   The trunks of the trees that line this portion of the street are a strange

in the 1970s; they're all pastel-colored, and have an assortment of electric
cars and vans parked in their driveways. Lone Star officers and the occasional
private security guard walk up and down the sidewalks, alongside a mix of
well-dressed elves and humans.

   A dull black traffic light sways from a cable overhead, its lights
flickering, and a few skidmarks along one side of the road tell of some
narrowly-avoided accident. The residences along this portion of the street are
a mixture of two-story houses and small co-ops. One of the lampposts along the
sidewalk also features a smog meter. Since most of the people walking by seem
not to be wearing any breathers, the readings are probably fairly good.

   You are now at the intersection of Highland and Sixth. Foot traffic is
light here, mostly consisting of young elven couples on romantic walks, and
humans walking their pets. The homes in this area are kept very clean, and the
sidewalk is free of litter and defacement. A traffic light hangs over the
intersection, controling the flow of traffic.

larger. Elegent but plain two-story houses give way to those with two car
gargages and pools in back. The occasional trampoline lends the feel of
children and other miscreants of the middle-class.

   The surrounding neighborhood is nicer than most you might expect to find in
a city sprawl of any kind, yet there are still classic reminders that you're
in the sprawl and not some fancy suburb. Various things like tall, boxlike, if
posh, apartment complexes obscure a clear view of the horizon from any
viewpoint. The large building to the south that is the Matchstick Nightclub is
another reminder of the sprawl, and the ramp leading to an underground garage
likely used as loading/unloading for the club further jars the memory.

   You are on a small stretch of road between Valley Road to the south, and
Highland Drive to the north. A small emergency phone is here, offering a way
for wealthy residents of this area to call upon the LoneStar or the Fire
Department incase of emergency. In the distance you hear faint laughter of
children, and a deep voice, most likely their father, playing with them.

   The vehicles and pedestrians that traverse this section of street tend
towards the upper class - the cars are new and expensive, and the people are
well-dressed. The houses and apartment buildings here look fairly pricey and
well cared-for, as well. Both Lone Star police and patrol vehicles are a
constant presence here, as one would expect in such an obviously wealthy
neighborhood. A small, single-story office building is sandwiched between two
large houses to the south; a discreet grey plaque on its door reads,
"Sixth-Age Clinical Consulting."

and fancy residential buildings that occupy its well-kept sidewalks and the
many expensive new cars that cruise along the immaculately-paved street. With
money comes protection, and the Lone Star presence in the area is strong.
Several cars can be seen on the side of the road, pulled over for traffic
violations. A biosculpting shop to the southeast offers expensive cosmetic
enhancements for those who can afford them; Northwest Seventh continues to the
north, and Valley Road stretches east and west.

   Children can be heard playing behind a ferrocrete wall here, bouncing a
ball against it as the occasional "You're out!" sounds out into the street.
Two teens on Rapiers speed by, honking their horns at the slow-moving Ford
ahead of them as they speed by on either side of it.

Desc:$
   Second Street meets with Denny Way here as the air starts to get a little
smoggier than most places.  The end of the residential section comes near as
the longest street in Seattle keeps meandering east and west.  Nice looking
houses sit to the north, and a maintenance shop for vehicles is there.  Looks
closed, though.

   Some of the last apartment complexes in this area sit here, the three-story
developments looking to be catering to families numbering in the threes or
fours.  Some have a gate leading inside, but the majority either do not, or
the gate doesn't work, rendering it useless.  The open-air parking lot seems
to be a hotbed of criminal activity, of the grand theft auto variety. Better
watch your stereo.

   Houses and apartments become more sporadic as they become intermixed with
warehouses.  There's a smell of burning rubber in the air, very faint, but
definitely there.  Smoke plumes rise to the south from here, one fairly close,
and from the honking you could assume someone needs a new car.

   The factories are close by now, while the housing developments to the north

increasing levels of pollution in the area, or just the fact you're closer to
industry than clean (sort of) living.

northern direction seems to bring better housing.

sides.  The vehicles are average, being not trashy nor fancy.  Several groups
of kids walk, and with semblance, adults walk on by. A couple of useless shops
are here and there while a small club is on the eastern corner. This
neighborhood integrates metas and humans equally, as one can see they are all
around.

bullet holes- is very evident.

Name:	Harrison Boulevard
Desc:$
   This is the low rent district of Seattle's residential area.  Shabby
apartment complexes litter the landscape, with several gangers cruising the
area.  Garbage litters the underkept streets while several chipheads scrounge
for money to supply their next fix.

Desc:$
   The traffic fills the air under this overpass, with the sounds of the
freeway above you. You hear a myriad of automotive sounds being muffled
through meters of tarmac and plasticrete, from the buzzing of motorcycles to
the wall of sound created when a cargo truck passes overhead. A relatively
unassuming club is to the north. 
~
NightDesc:$
   While empty during the day, at night the area under the overpass is packed
to the brim with deckers waiting to get into Syberspace, the hottest club for
anyone who's anyone on the Matrix. Loud, thumping techno can be heard
eminating from the club to the north, a massive light show lighting up the
area in an assortment of hues.

Desc:$
   If the wealthy patrons entering and exiting were not a clue, this is the
lobby to one of the higher class, more prestigious living quarters in Seattle.
The lobby is extremely decorative; mahogany trim lines the walls, and a
crystal chandelier dangles from above, providing eloquent lighting.  There are
several couches, black leather, for patrons to relax in.  A reception counter
is close to the elevator bank to the east.

Expensive paintings hang from the walls, mostly showing portraits of the sea,

   A busy kitchen, full of everything a chef could need.  A large stove to
cook many dishes on, and a enormous oven for all the baking needs.  Smells
drift around, with all sorts of delicacies moving on trays carried by waiters
young and old.  Lobster and shrimp, steak, salads, even assorted foreign meals
from places such as europe and the far east.  The wafting smells can easily
destract an observer from noticing how coordinated the hussle and bussle

   Dark and sinister, this hallway is forboding. Seemingly pitchblack, red
eyes glow from the shadows in very direction. What first appears to be a
raised tentacle lies across the floor.  Closer examination would reveal an
intricate painting, made to give depth to the two dimenional tile. The entire
hallway is dark, and almost appears to be a large room, but from the echos of
sounds, the length and depth of the hallway can be imagined.

   A difference on this floor, other than its darker, more evil decor, is the
lack of a window. In its place is the same black wall, with the staring red
eyes, glowing, like beasts ready to attack at any moment. Again, tentacles
sprawl across the floor, attempting to entangle a weary travler, and have
their way with him. The doors to 3C, to the East, and  3D to the West are
here, and where the peephole should be is a single forboding eye, a darker
crimson, and its style is like it was drawn with fresh blood, as it has drips
that ran down the door a short way. The spookiness of the hallway alone would
be sufficent protection against prowlers, visitors, and Jehovah's Witnessess.

   Not a typical lobby, it contains the same level of decor as the other
floors, but in an outdoor motif.  Reminiscent of the old Pacific Northwest,
the walls display old redwoods, and the floor is a tiled mural, made to look
like the floor of a forest, complete with leaves and undergrowth.  The lights
are dim, maybe for privacy, maybe for the lack of light underneath the massive
canopy's of the giant trees.  Suites are found to the south.

it's perimeter a 2 inwide, decorated gold frame, represents a large mirror in
the room.  It looks over the street, five stories beneath, and the buildings
of Seattle, large and small, can be seen, expanding far out.  The doors, large
and strong, are 5C, to the east, and 5D to the west. Around them the ballroom
expands northward towards the elevator. There is what appears to be a bar,
tended by several people, with vaarious customers drinking from glasses, mugs,
chalices, even martini glasses. All in all it is the end of a magnificent and
detailed scene.
