   The Rose Garden Expressway winds around the Rose Garden Arena, a massive
sports complex where the Portland Lords baseball franchise, the Portland
Trailblazers basketball franchise, and the Portland Marchers hurling franchise
all play.  Three massive behemoths of sports arenas sit on the western side of
the highway, dwarfed only by the Rose Garden parking garage.

   Rose Garden Expressway whips around the Rose Garden Sports Complex and ends
at the Broadway Bridge which goes into Northwest Portland.  On the west side
of the expressway is the South Arena, the oldest of the three massive stadiums
in this complex, built a long time ago by Paul Allen, one of the first people
to become supremely rich by the corporation long dead after the Crash of '29
and the Renraku buyouts.

   The Broadway Bridge rises high over the Willamette River, the river that
the city of Portland is built around.  The water below looks green and mucky,
and the bridge itself is quite dark and rusty, as if it hasn't been renovated
in about twenty years. Traffic is lined up from bumper to bumper most of the
time, and you hear car horns being activated liberally, and the occasional
sperethiel profanities being shouted out by the drivers.

   Tall warehouse type buildings from the twentieth century worn from over a
century's worth of rain, patched up from about a centuries worth of half-assed
renovation attempts to just make building codes, make for some very ugly
eyesores. And that is what you see in this particular stretch of the Portland
area.  You see grafitti all over the walls, signs of gang activity, as well as
the usual freaks and tweaks you find in the less well-off portions of any
city.  Even the elven nation has their dregs of society.
   A very ugly warehouse, six stories tall, covered in rust stands northwest
from here.

will choose an elf, and will sell you a full course meal for 3 nuyen.  On the
walls are various artworks featuring the homeless, and hobos from many eras
ranging from the 1920's to the 2020's, to today's hapless Tir Tairngire
untouchables.  Many signs are on the walls with political statements
sympathizing with more liberal causes, environmental causes, and homeless

was shut down.  Some rat droppings can be seen on the floor, indicative of the
vermin that make this warehouse their home.  It is rather dark here, as no
light or electricity is supplied to this place, as there are no tenants here
officially.  A green ^gEXIT^n sign with a broken glass front points eastward.  A
sign pointing to a fire extinguisher that is no longer present is on the
eastern wall.

Desc:$
   A loading platform with a sliding steel door leading outside is here, where
truckers used to hoist crates full of cargo onto trucks to be shipped to
places all over what used to be Oregon.  The steel sliding door is jammed, and
can not be opened, as it is rusted shut so tightly it may as well have been
welded shut.  A sign points to a fire extinguisher that is no longer there,
probably used as a weapon by some ganger long ago.  The air is thick with the
smell of rust and humidity.  Some rat droppings are on the floor.

taking your life into your own hands climbing these stairs, one would guess,

advertise many services, products, and companies in Sperethiel characters,
which look alot like Kanji when done in neon, and English letters.  The rain

image of this intersection is something like a smaller scale Times Square with
large media signs constantly shovelling trideo commercial content down the

pictograms with the splash of color, a surreal image only visible in the Sixth

Desc:$
   A stretch of parking lot between office high-rises gives a place for people
working or visiting the Old Town district to place their cars with some
security.  Cars and trucks, vans and bikes all sit in neat rows, and a booth
holds an attendant who watches for things such as theft and vandalism.

   Sixth Street runs here between the bustle of Burnside and the relative calm
of Couch Street, between two rain stained buildings holding offices.  The
Toadstool is a bar that inhabits the lower floor of the building on the east
side of the street, a grungy place that sees a few local bands on its stage.

Name:	Entrance to The Toadstool
Desc:$
   A bar and grill with a clientele of more than just elves, unlike most
venues in the city of Portland.  The Toadstool is not exactly tres chic, not
exactly upper crust, in fact one would say it was ghetto.  It is, however a
decent place to make contacts within the city of Portland, if you are of a
shadow orientation.  Some graffiti, written in green paint, is scrawled on the
left hand pillar along the entrance archway.

the spaces of the walls where no pictures hang.  Cigarette smoke dominates
your olfactory senses, and rhythmic music plays inside.

   The cigarette smoke is quite thick here, giving those with low constitution
watering and red eyes.  Some pool tables are lined up here, few functional
enough to support an actual game.  Knife marks and gouges into the felt
surface of the pool tables tends to make a table not function properly.  The
floor is linoleum with big scuffed marks where dried and caked globs of
plaster once held a carpet in place, long since removed.  Orks, trolls,
dwarves, and humans seem to frequent this place far more often than anybody
else, and some candles are mounted on the wall, to give this place an ambience
particular to only this place.  The walls are a dark midnight blue, with a
cornflower blue tone to them.  The ceiling is a black painted plaster, with
various party lights set up every few meters.

   A large parking lot is here, with many cars and ambulances parked in neat,
tidy rows.  The tarmac on this parking lot is very well kept, and is a clean
black color.  The Tir Tairngire Royal Hospital is a old, late 20th century
brick building, though is state of the art in its facilities, and is
maintained exceedingly well, to the point to where one might think it was
built recently.  Helicopters buzz off the rooftop where a Helicopter Rescue
Unit makes for snappy recovery of those critically ill or injured.

Burnside, you see the road slope past the overpass for Interstate 405, well
beyond the main Powell's Bookstore.   The delectable smell of real high
quality pizza passes your nostrils for a moment, and as you look westward
again, you see the sign for Rocco's Pizza. Neon signs line Burnside in

background, singing "Heartbreak Hotel" with uncanny reverence.  Soap bubbles
float about the air, coming from a bubble dispenser that reads "Religious
Bubbles".  Artworks abound on the walls of this strange synagogue, of Elvis
Presley with a saint's halo, in a glowing white rhinestone bell-bottom suit.
Organs accompany the recorded choir.

   At the end of this strange temple are some silver streamers hanging over an

the high priestess, a sort of lady who looks spun out of her gourd, wearing
horn rimmed glasses covered with sequins, offers to sell you a holy relic, a
Church of Elvis t-shirt.  A sign on the wall reads "Weddings - 5 nuyen

infamous?) street in alternative lifestyles circles.  Looking west to
Thirteenth Street where it ends near the 405 Freeway, you see buildings draped
with ^Rr^Ya^Gi^Bn^Mb^Ro^Yw^n flags, and men wearing very tight clothes and leather hats.  The
'rainbow' stretch of Stark Street ends at Hamburger Mary's, the last stop
going eastward before Stark Street crosses Broadway and continues on into the

   Southwest Stark, on the east side of Broadway, is well known for its
friendliness to those of 'alternative' lifestyles.  Rainbow flags are draped
above the entrances to many of the venues along this street, a one-way street
carrying little traffic by car, much traffic by foot.  Men wearing tight
shorts and tank tops walk up and down the street holding hands, women with
crewcuts wearing leathers do the same.  To the west are venues such as
"Roxy's", the "Fish Grotto", "The Jail", and the "Panorama".  You are standing
in front of Hamburger Mary's, an 'alternative lifestyles' restaurant.

clean neon storefronts on the ground level.  Large neon signs, mostly in
Sperethiel hang on top of the various storefronts, flashing in many different
radiant colors.  The sidewalks on this side of Broadway are done in brick,
rather than concrete, glistening in the streetlights and neon from the nearly
constant rains that pour onto Portland's streets.

   Southwest Stark and Sixth criss cross here, two small but high traffic
one-way streets, at an intersection with a stoplight.  The stoplights do not
have buttons to press for the "walk" signals to cross on foot, as pedestrian
traffic crosses here constantly.  Northeast is the TTB Tower (Tir Tairngire
Bank), an odd shaped building that was in many ways a forerunner to the
architectural styles of the Sixth World.  Its a sort of ruddy brown marble
color with mirror finished windows that climbs many stories high, putting a
golden cast onto the streets on those rare days when the sun is out.  The
sidewalks are made of brick, not the usual concrete you see elsewhere, adding
to the 'high-class' corporate feel of the Southwest Corporate Sector of the
downtown area.

   Sixth Street runs in front of the TTB Tower (aka TTBank), a large reddish
brown 'marble' colored building with mirrored windows with a golden tint.  The
TTB Tower was a prototype for much of the architecture of the Sixth World, and
is oddly shaped, with a rhombus shaped foundation.  Its brownish pink color
sets the color scheme of many other buildings built during that time, only
other survivor of that age of architecture, though different, is the KON tower
deeper into Southwest.  Tall corporate skyscrapers overshadow you in this
sector, with neon signs in Sperethiel all along the lowest level over the
storefronts at the ground floor.

"Ancients" seen in the graffiti in a few places.  This is Old Town, home to
dirty old brick buildings that should have been condemned years ago, but still
find use amongst the lower classes as squats and storefronts, as well as the
occasional office building.
