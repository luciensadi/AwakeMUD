Name:	Harbour Avenue and Ridgeway Street
Desc:$
   Food wrappers, leaflets and the occasional dried leaf drift across the
cracked sidewalks of this none-too-clean intersection. A dry, cold breeze
whistles through the street, silenced occasionally by the distant rumbling of
factories along Seattle's outer skyline, and various cars from what seems like
another age pass quietly by.

Name:	Harbour Avenue
Desc:$
   Harbour Avenue runs north and south along the more desolate western edge of
downtown Seattle's industrial district. Many of the storefronts here are
boarded over, with the exception of what seems to be a thriving restaurant to
the west. A moderately busy bus station, which provides transportation to
other cities, is to the east.

   Just a few blocks away from the district center, a small group of children
play with a skipping rope and divide their attention between the various
trideo screens in a storefront displaying the newest skipping rope available.
With extra sparkle.

   A taxi lulls idly by across the street, the owner more interested in
listening to a baseball game than actually picking up passengers. Behind him,
a small store that appears to sell candy and porn seems to be attracting more
than a fair share of shoppers.

   The whirring of factory fans overhead begins to camouflage the incessant

factories in the area, in an effort to both increase employment in the area,
and keep their operations out of the public eye.

   Ridgeway runs into First Street here at a busy cross-street intersection.
Traffic is poorly managed and gets backed up quite often here, in close
proximity to Intercity Five. Ridgeway east of here moves close to the towering
spires of downtown's higher-density commercial sector, through an artist and
nightclub sector. Many of the city's more bohemian elements frequent the many
shops, clubs, and coffee holes that you find on the next two blocks east of
here, before reaching the portion of downtown populated by tall towers of
plasticrete and steel. A small neon sign above a doorway to the northeast
reads, "^RLe Cinema Vieux^n."

Name:	First Street
Desc:$
   First Street is a working-class stretch of the southeast commercial
district of downtown Seattle. It's a bunch of brick and plasticrete tenements,
stained with years worth of rain, and shopfronts on the first floor. There are
two newspaper vending boxes with the Seattle Times and Seattle Sun here, two
competing papers with different angles. Seattle Times is more hard news,
whereas the Seattle Sun is an unrepentant screamsheet or tabloid. The traffic
is thick to moderate here, and the air is full of the sound of a freeway
within close proximity. An open doorway to the east leads into a small brick
brownstone, its rather dirty plate glass window advertising a theatrical
supply shop.

Name:	First Street and Espanoza Way
Desc:$
   On the very western end of the southeast commercial district of Downtown
Seattle, this intersection, infamous throughout North America as the most
accident prone,  is full of a nightmare of jammed vehicles, speeders, and
places to be cut off.  Just west of here is the Intercity Five exit, and many
drivers forced to drive quickly down the exit, find themselves being forced to
stop abruptly after going down the offramp.  The traffic is stop and go at all
hours, the lights are poorly timed, and the smog is thick. On the sidewalks
are crowds of people in breathers and raincoats, to gird their lungs from the
smog and acid rain fumes.   A lost pet poster is plastered against the
stoplight pole.

   Largely a diversified working-class block between Whitman and Espanoza,
First street is lined with newsstands, ramen noodle stands, soy dog stands,
and apartment complexes with storefronts on the first floor, selling books and
second hand clothes.  On the east side of the street is a boarded up
storefront, formerly a bar named after a mafia kingpin named "Pook".

   Second and Whitman meet at a busy intersection.  The poorly timed stoplight
here has created a traffic jam that exists on a near 24 hour a day basis.
Messengers on bicycles whip through the gridlocked traffic, using the spaces
in between the lanes to get ahead of the parking-lot like traffic conditions.
The air is filled with a vague smoggy smell, and people in breathers are a
common sight here.

from the various gangs that inhabit the Seattle area, from the Brain Eaters to
the Ancients to the Halloweeners, in their various colours, crossing out each
others to mark this as their turf.  Sirens fill the air in the distance to the

Name:	Interstate 5 at Interstate 90 Junction
Desc:$
   A very large mish-mash of exit off- and on-ramps make this place
interesting.  When you boil it down to which way goes where though, I-5 runs
southwest to northeast and I-90 runs southeast from here, then up the road
curves east.

   I-5 is a mixed bag here, with traffic running northeast to northwest.
During rush hours it can be quite congested, as the highway runs north to
Renton and Everett.  Along the east and west sides of the freeway are mixed
residential and commercial districts, and to the distant east you can see the
Aztechnology Pyramid in all its glory.  A sign is here saying "Harrison Exit
1/2 km, Exit 19".

   Second Street runs up along the western borough of the southern commercial
district, and is home to a lot of the more vibrant shopping citadels. The
streets are almost always packed, and the constant flow of consumers can
almost make you lose your way. Luckily, you can see intersections a little
north and south of here.

full of trash are lined up at the curb.  The air smells of smog, acid rain
fumes, and trash.  A PanicButton(tm) is on a telephone pole, allowing a
citizen to dial up for quick help from Lone Star in the event of a crime.  A
large trid billboard for Novatech is on the west side of the street, full of
vibrant colour.

Graffiti and handbills mar the plasticrete walls of the various apartment

Name:	Ridgeway Street
Desc:$
   The largely commercial Ridgeway Street is dominated by older brick office
buildings that have been well-kept since the late twentieth century when they
were built.  Ivy covers a large portion of the buildings, growing thick in
season.  The street is lined with a myriad of art galleries, coffee shops,
with regular poetry meetings and open mic nights, and nightclubs of the mid to
upper scale.

   Third Street is lined with prefab towers and highrise buildings, with
various restaurants populating the bottom floor of each, excepting the
occasional Brute Power(tm) day labour outlets.  Mounds of garbage accumulated
from weeks of poor waste management line each curb at regular intervals.
Above, are many office spaces full of bored workers for various corporations
renting the space.

   Third and Spring meet at a busy intersection, with traffic flowing at a
near constant speed.  Third and Spring become one-way streets as you go east
and north of here, as an effort to engineer traffic to remain constantly in
motion, rather than at a standstill like the streets west of here.  East of
here are great towers and monoliths of plasticrete and steel, temples of the
great god Nuyen who rules this age.

gone to great lengths to make the streets safe for shoppers again, and the
multitude of cameras and hidden imaging systems no doubt help to ease tension.

large traffic jams instigated by automotive accidents.  The turn signal setup
seems bizarre to any rationally minded driver, confusing just about anybody

you can turn left, the next lane you can turn right, the next lane you better
turn right or you will run into a curb on the other side of the street as you
get cut off, and so forth.

Name:	Whitman Road
Desc:$
   Whitman Road runs along the northern end of the southeast sector, against
Intercity 90, which is up on a very large concrete embankment that towers up
at least five stories high.  The embankment is covered in graffiti and
handbills advertising various media events.

from the Seattle Center. The building's enormous structure stands right in the
middle of the commercial district, flanked by promenades and an open square,

Center and Renraku Arcology down the street. This is effectively the center of
the city, and the sheer traffic congestion backs that up. Down to the west,
you can see an almost endless line of boutiques, restaurants and cafes, all
sweeping weary pedestrians off the streets.

Desc:$
   A large portion of the traffic, both on the street and on the road seems
immediately drained from view, and sucked in towards the Seattle Center. Not
unlike the centrepiece of the downtown neighbourhood, it attracts both
residents and tourists alike, with its huge structure containing a wealth of
different restaurants, boutiques, and other consumer heavens. The wide
concrete square surrounding the center gives space to people to relax and
pause along the tree-lined promenades that lead you into the Center.  A two
story structure is dwarfed to the south, a plasticrete school of sorts.

comfortable yellow and orange wash, slowly introducing the evening to the city
as shoppers begin to thin out. Though several smaller shops will generally
close around five or six in the afternoon, the larger malls and boutiques take
pride in staying open far later, just to mop up the last remnants of the day's
consumers. Strobes and spotlights flash from the doorway of a small boutique
to the south.

NightDesc:$
   The modest crowds during the day explode at night as The Platinum Club
becomes busy, attracting people from all over the sprawl looking for a good
time. People of all ages and denominations bustle in and out of the small
alley to the north. Those leaving tend to stumble, obviously intoxicated on
either drink or something more illicit. Traffic is scarce here at night, as
many revellers stumble into the road to continue the party. One clothing
boutique still has its doors open however, its music and lights trying their
hardest to outdo the Platinum Club across the road.

waft drearily through the corrugated iron window blinds.

   The twin sides of the alley appear to be almost leaning in on you, and as
you gaze further upon the structures, such an assumption is not entirely
incorrect. While the office blocks and multiplex buildings that populate the
area are fairly well constructed by regulation, it's not uncommon for many of
them to need some significant repairs.

Name:	North Fifth Street and Broadway Northeast
Desc:$
   Fifth Street runs into Broadway at a very complex intersection here, where
traffic from I-90, Northeast, and Southeast all converge on one very congested
spot.  Traffic here is at a standstill at all hours, seemingly, despite
efforts to manage traffic here through the much-ballyhooed GridGuide(tm)
system of motion sensors and onboard systems on automobiles.

   Broadway Northeast is a very busy stretch of street, cutting through the

GridGuide motion sensor array, keeping the stoplights timed rather well, so
that despite its large traffic level, congestion never gets ridiculous, even
within rush hour peak times.

of traffic at all hours.  The sidewalks are lined with busy people mostly
wageslaves wearing breathers and rain jackets of all colours.  Lone Star has a
heavy presence in this area, to grant the wageslaves a false sense of security
that will keep them productive. A tall parking garage to the north made of
steel and plasticrete creates a large eyesore.

stoplights changing per prompt of the GridGuide systems.  An array of security
cameras stand on top of the stoplight system, recording traffic violations and
sending them to Lone Star Security's traffic department.

Name:	North Seventh and NE Gray Street
Desc:$
   Seventh and Grey intersect here. A series of apartments are to the west,
and a small grocery store and some houses are to the north. Skyscrapers to the
far south cast long shadows over the neighborhood; to the east, the
Aztechnology Pyramid towers over all.

   Northward you see monstrous goliaths of skyscrapers that reach up into
heaven itself seemingly, vast corporate temples of greed and power.  Seventh
ends south of here at a high embankment covered in graffiti, where I-90 runs
through, carrying with it the sounds of a vastly congested ten lane freeway, a
sea of engine sounds, screeching tires, and honking horns.

   Seventh ends here, and curves eastward into Ridgeway Northeast, a side
street running parallel to I-90.  On the south side of the street a tall
concrete embankment stands, leading up to the I-90 freeway itself, where the
sounds of seemingly millions of engines, screeching tires, and car horns fill
the air.  The embankment is covered in graffiti, mostly cryptic-looking tag
writing that amounts to arguing about which gang owns this turf.

that are only dwarfed by the Renraku Arcology and Aztechnology.  On the ground
level, a four lane street is thick with traffic, busses, and taxicabs, all
fighting to get up to the next block, whichever way they are headed.
Newsstands line up on each side of the street in fierce competition.  A food
service truck is set up selling meals during work hours.

Desc:$
   No matter what time of night or day, this grimy, brightly-lit building is
never empty. Travellers and their luggage occupy the cracked plastic seats or
wander aimlessly around the garage at the far eastern end of the station,
where buses pick up and drop off their passengers; station personnel sell
tickets and perform their other duties; bums try to look as if they have a
legitimate purpose. While travel to most cities is currently unavailable,
Hellhound's deal with the Portland Chamber of Commerce, which allows them to
provide service to and from Portland, is a huge advantage over other
companies. Hellhound was known by another name in the Fifth World; the change
aside, the company continues to work hard to provide the working class with a
way to travel.

   Turnstiles separate the garage from the main lobby of the bus depot, with
passengers coming from and going to the bus to their destinations.  A few bums
sit with their packs, trying to look like they are waiting for their bus that

ordered not to.  It's hard to find a warm place away from the Seattle rainfall
to these poor chummers.
