Name:	Lobby
Desc:$
   A large immaculate lobby, brightly lit by subtly disguised fluorescent
lighting. The silence is broken only by the gentle sweep of the revolving
doors, providing access to the street. A bored looking receptionist doesn't
look up at your approach, and continues slowly organising her desk. A small
tiled corridor leads off to the west and an unremarkable door with a small
'Staff Only' sign is behind the reception desk to the north.

Name:	The main showroom
Desc:$
   A large showroom. Glass display cases line the walls, each with small
holographic images of what appear to be small mechanical robots spinning
slowly in space. Small metal plaques are mounted beneath each, with what
appear to be model numbers etched on them, corresponding to numbers on a large
sign mounted in a frame on one wall.

   This room is full of large, rack mounted computers, on display as the best
of the best. Here and there small patches of light yellow wall can be
glimpsed, but almost every spare inch has been covered. White, overhead
lighting creates odd shadows on the floor, and the buzz from the various
machines seems to work as an effective white noise generator, blocking out all
sounds of the outside world.

   A pair of fluorescent tubes casts everthing in a sharp white light, the
single window here has its blinds pulled closed. The walls are the same light
yellow as the hallway outside, and a number of tables are pushed hard up
against them. On these tables, a series of computer towers and flat monitors
sit, quietly humming. This year's models are all finished in stylish black
with chrome highlights and are reminiscent of late twentieth century machines.

   Stacks of large boxes and crates make this place seem more like a warehouse
athan a showroom. A microtronics workshop has been set up in the center of the

Despite the mess surrounding them, the tools are set up neatly and the
workshop seems to shine with that "just been polished" gleam.

action to cyberdecks and cyberterminals lined up in displays for testing, the
place reeks class. A smiling, middle aged human stands behind the counter,
waiting for you to ask for help.
