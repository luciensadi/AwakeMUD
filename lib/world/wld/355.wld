Name:	Entrance to Dante's Inferno
Desc:$
   The Novahot club that always remains ahead of the game of the nightclub
scene.  Dante's Inferno is nine levels deep, not up, each level becoming more
and more exclusive.  The music coming from the inside is the sounds of cutting
edge chainsaw-techno, something to the ears of a twentieth century listener
would be reminiscent of KMFDM or early Ministry.  There is a red glow on the
walls on the inside. ^WA sign reads^L: ^RNO PARKING^y - Violators Will Be Towed^n.
Arrows direct drivers to the northeast and southeast, into the Dante's Inferno
underground garage.

Name:	Abandon All Hope....
Desc:$
   The hallways here are a pseudo-stone colored white, with red lights bent to
luminesce like fires.  The floor is covered with a sulfurous smoke.  A large
troll with a large metal box checks people coming into the club for weaponry,
and if they have weaponry he stores it.  Holographic imps and demons appear on
the walls at random intervals.  A huge sign in front of the archway to the
interior of the club reads, "Abandon all hope, oh ye who enter."

Name:	Descent...
Desc:$
   A downward staircase, made with black volcanic stone blanketed in sulfurous
smoke.  The walls are a glowing red stone that seemingly doesn't give off
heat.  They are very realistically crafted magma-like stones.  Holographs of
tortured spirits flash on the wall at random patterns.  Occasional recordings
of screams fill the air.

Desc:$
   Loud rhythmic music fills the air, vibrating every bone in your body.  The
ceiling is covered in various hellish holographs and light schemes, and covers
the area in bright lights that appear to engulf the people in the club in
flames.  The ceiling is a see through glass ceiling with fire and magma
sculptures and flames, either holographic or real below you.  Near the ceiling
mounted on the walls are sinister-looking gargoyle figures, seemingly glaring
down at the crowd.

   The music vibrates through your skull in a sharp hypnotic rhythm.  The
ceiling is covered with holographs and sculptures of hanging bodies, tortured
souls, imps and daemons, and many other of the imagined minions of Hell.
There are bright lights mounted on the ceiling, not classic incandescent
nightclub lights, but phosphorescent morph-lighting that forms shapes,
controlled by computer.  They cast a red furnace-light affect on everyone in
the vicinity, seemingly engulfing the habitues of Dante's Inferno in flames.

   The music thickly fills the air, and small dancefloors are laid out at
regular intervals, with see-through floors.  Under the glass tiles that make
up the dance floors are rocks that luminesce a soft, ^rblood red^n color.  Red
lights fill the air, coming from ceiling fixtures, creating a look of
engulfment upon the people in the nightclub.  Sulfurous clouds of smoke
regularly cover the floor and drift away.

Desc:$
   From the span to the south, the floor seems to begin moving downward,
deeper in its descent to the next level.  Every fifteen meters or so, there is
a step moving downward, making the incline gradual.  The air is thick with the
smoke of the decadance of Seattle, adding to the fiery atmosphere.  The music
is thick and rhythmical, making the bones vibrate in synchronicity to the
sounds that fill the club.

   The spiral ends or begins here, upward to the south, and the First level of
Dante's.  The music is thick and hypnotically rhythmic, and the dark red
lights fluctuate, creating an illusory effect of the denizens of the club
being on flames.  The walls are a dark red color that luminesces vaguely, and
holographs of devils and daemons, imps and tortured souls appear on the
ceiling and under the glass of the floor where you can see magma floating
beneath you.

glowing red eyes that seem to move in such a way that is not common to

flowing magma streams.  Above, where the ceiling is, are holographs of
tortured souls, imps, and daemons.

obsidian with gargoyles and pseudo-incantations in 'hieroglyphic' form.

   Spiralling deep into the underground 'caverns' of Dante's Inferno, the
Second Hell curves southward from here to where the Third level starts.
Covering the ceiling are holographic dancing daemons and imps, torturing souls
mounted on pikes.  Along the edge of the walls are statues of gargoyles with
glowing red eyes, and sulfurous smoke eminating from their nostrils.  A large
pole covered in ceramic human skulls shows where the level whips around
southward, leading down farther into the Third Hell.  A Bulletin Board System
is set up to the northwest, and a restaurant is set up to the west.

   An interesting name for an eatery, but it doesn't seem out of place in the
hellish decorum of Dante's Inferno.  This is where to go to find stuffers to
fill up on for a few levels.  Here you can find batwing sandwiches made of
chicken, a juicy hellburger, and drinks of both the alcoholic and
non-alcoholic variety.  Behind the bar is an ork with glowing red cybereyes
wearing a chef's hat, and using a small pitchfork as a spatula.

Name:	The Third Hell
Desc:$
   The third level downward into Dante's netherworld begins here, coming from
the Second Hell north of here.  The music is a grinding rhythmic sound that
cuts to the bone.  The floors are obsidian black, which eerily reflects the
red lights coming from above.  Along the walls are statues of daemons and imps
with a bit of puppetering technology thrown in, making them swivel and move,
while breathing steam as their eyes glow red.

   The obsidian black floors reflect darkly the dark fire-red lights arranged
up above.  Near the ceiling are statues of gargoyles and daemons moving and
swivelling to the music as fire and steam comes out of their facial orifaces.
The walls resemble volcanic rock, with the look of jet black obsidian.
Torches are arranged along the walls.

red eyes, and smoke coming from their nostrils.  The red lights from the
lighting system fluctuate with the rhythm of the band on the stage, and are
cast to create an 'engulfing' effect on the crowd on the dance floor.

As you look down, you see the flows of magma from the east and west pouring
over the edge into a crevass that seems to plunge into the fathomless depths
of the heart of Hell. Even the skeletons floating in the boiling death-tide
seem to howl in terror as their unending plummet begins. Above it all howls
the music of Pink Freud, made all the more deliciously hellish by the flaring
red lights. On the south wall the row of statues goes on, this time demons
wielding spears and broadswords, glaring at the gargoyles in the east with a
look that could only be called bloodlust.

   A thick wall of black stone stands to the north, seperating this area from
a direct view of the stage. The see-through dancefloor is still present, with
its rivers of boiling red magma sweeping along the bones of the damned. Every
so often a skeleton can be seen clawing at the underside of the floor, never
quite finding the purchase to save itself from washing deeper into the bowels
of Hell. The blaring music of Pink Freud fills the air to a deafening roar,
and the red pulses from above give everyone the look of horrible, bloody
wounds - just the sort of thing true Dante's devotees live for.

and half dense black stone. Beneath the see-through flooring runs a blood-tide
of magma and bone. The wall of stone prevents any view to the stage, but the
music is still as loud. The wall itself is etched in a bas-relief of the court
of the demon prince Malbolgia, with demons and monsters of all sorts fighting,
feeding, and... mating wildly. Even the ceiling was not left out of the
detailing, with the image of a monstrous spider's web acid-etched into the
stone. A clockwork spider completes the look, occasionally spraying someone
with blood-red paint - at least, you have to hope it's just paint.

the side of a giant. Truly devout habitues of Dante's dance to the marvel that
is Pink Freud while bathing themselves in the smokey demon blood. The steps up
the stage are neatly hidden under the blanket of smoke, more easily located by
tripping over them than looking.

   The backdrop of the stage is a grotesque waterfall of blood and bones. The
floor is blanketed thickly with dense white smoke which, thanks to the pulses
red lights projected from above, seem to blend and merge with the bloodfalls
into a hideous three-dimensional mockery of art. This parody of all things
beautiful is continued by the band, who produce what only the most depraved
would call music. Every so often, the holo-projectors giving the lighting
display conjure up a chorus line of skeletons to rave to the noise.

   A scene only a demon - or a habitue of Dante's - would enjoy exists on the
stage. The backdrop is a waterfall of blood, with the occasional intact human
or metahuman skeleton visible in the crimson waves. Even the bloodfalls
themselves swirl into the demonic face of a screaming, tortured soul. At the
front of the stage, a row of color-shifting magical fire keeps most of the
dancers from charging the stage, and makes those who do regret it. The band
can really wail, and the smoke around their feet is in constant frenetic
motion as they dance to their own sound. Pulses of red light flood the stage,
projected from above, making the roiling steam cloud seem to blend into the
bloodfalls in random patches.

   Run in front of the bar is a long row of tables. Each one has a top of the
same high-durability see-through material as the dance floor and legs that
look like the rib-bones of some horribly large creature. The chairs at the
tables appear to be made of leg bones, with tight skins stretched between them
to form seats and backs. The wall is carved with a scene of a demonic battle,
perhaps a scene from the Bloodwars. If you can tell which ones are demons and
which ones are devils, you either know your arcane history very well, or
you've spent way too much time in Dante's.

   Finally, the bar! With all that dancing and music and raving, a drink would
be welcome (even with their selection). The bar is crafted of black-smoked
wood and carved with a spider's web motif that looks far too intricate to have
been done by living hands. Behind the spiderweb are the images of many
creatures - humanoid and otherwise, even a dragon or two - locked away, most
pulling at the spiderweb, seeking freedom that will never come. All of the
lights are slow-moving red pulsers, giving the room the feeling of being
filled with blood. Darting between it all is a tall, red-skinned troll with
wings, the barkeep.

Name:	The Fourth Hell - By the Bar
Desc:$
   The row of bone-crafted chairs continues, forming another neat row. The
wall this time is not carved with a scene at all. Instead, various visitors
have scratched lines from appropriate poems into the softer black stone of
this section. Favorite poets seem to be Edgar Allan Poe, Emily Dickenson, and
William Blake, among others. The red lights are of course omnipresent, making
reading the poetry a little eye-straining for the unaccustomed.

Because I could not stop for Death
 He kindly stopped for me;

 For his civility.

Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be
restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place & governs the
unwilling.
 And being restrain'd it by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow
of desire.
 The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, & the Governor or Reason is
call'd Messiah.
 And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host,
is call'd the Devil or Satan and his children are call'd Sin & Death.
 But in the Book of Job Miltons Messiah is call'd Satan.
 For this history
has been adopted by both parties.
 It indeed appear'd to Reason as if Desire was cast out, but the Devil's
account is, that the Messiah fell, & formed a heaven of what he stole from the
Abyss.

Name:	The Fourth Hell - Stairs Downward
Desc:$
   For those who survived the Fourth Hell and have the intestinal fortitude to
go deeper, the stairs begin here. Thankfully, they are not see-through.
Instead, each rail is an elongated bone. The stairs themselves are hollow and
filled with red fluid. When stepped on, the stairs ripple internally, though
their outer structure never moves. The howling music of Pink Freud can be
heard here only dully, muted as it is by the bar area.

Name:	Spiralling Down the Abyss
Desc:$
   The blood-filled stairs gradually fade out, as does the intense heat and
pounding noise from above. The stairs become pockets of cobalt-blue fluid that
shift internally when stepped upon, and the lighting shifts from fiery red to
an almost arctic blue. The bone rails are replaced first by bones encased in
ice, then simply by long, thick plastic icicles. Water trickles endlessly down
these poles, giving them the illusion of melting and reforming before your
eyes. As the music of Pink Freud becomes a vauge memory, it is slowly overlaid
with the music of the Fifth Hell - the Hell of Ice - which is a slow,
crystalline sort of techno played entirely on electronic equipment, as no
natural device could make a sound like that.

   The staircase ends in a relatively small, poorly lit room. It is somewhat
chilly here, and the only light is a pale blue radiance emanating from the
next room. The doorway into the Fifth Hell is a huge demon's face made of
translucent plastic and lit from within by an unearthly cobalt-blue glow. To
enter, you must walk between its teeth, into the gaping maw of Hell.

Name:	The Fifth Hell
Desc:$
   The Fifth Hell is wholly unlike the Hells above it. Instead of darkness or
rock, fire or noise, the Fifth Hell is a Hell of Ice. The walls are all
paneled in clear material that looks like ice, and, thanks to the over-cranked
air conditioning and fog machines, coated in enough frost to give it an icy
feeling as well. The frosty air is filled with creepy, chill ice-techno that
no normal instrument could produce. Oddly enough, the floor is not slippery.
Despite the cold, habitues of the Fifth Hell still come scantily clad, though
skimpy furs are more common than leather.

   The icy blue/white floor continues, as do the translucent walls. From the
ceiling hang hundreds upon hundreds of long, thin icicles, every one of them
looking poised to drop. About half of them glow brightly from within, shining
a cobalt blue light out into the room. It is these shining spines that give
most of the Fifth Hell it's frosty blue glow. It also gives this stretch the
illusion of being under water. The hauntingly chilly techno music is just the
slightest bit fainter here.

   The Fifth Hell nears its end in all its icy glory. To the east is another
stylized demon's maw leading off toward the decent to the next Hell. The
clusters of glowing icicles thin out, but the techno music becomes louder. The
floor is shrouded in thick, heavy fog. The walls seem to weep as the ice
melts. Occasionally, sections of wall slowly shift their form, giving the
appearance of constantly reforming sheets of ice.

   Here begins a narrow chute. Made of something at least as slick as real
ice, and again made to look just like it, the chute spirals tightly as it
leads downward. The pale blue luminesence of the Fifth Hell seems to fade, as
does the cold. It seems the air conditioning further down isn't cracked up
quite so high. Where the chute leads is impossible to tell through the thick
cloud of fog being blown across the shaft opening.

Name:	The Fifth Hell - The Cyber Pit
Desc:$
   This room is a miniature labyrinth unto itself - a maze of technological
drek the likes of which you've never seen. It all seems to be tied together
somehow, all for the purpose of filling the air with the creepy, almost
paranormal, techno that gives the Hell of Ice it's atmosphere. Every bit of
the machinery is built of plastics or ceramics in shades of blue and white,
maintaining the ice motif. The air conditioning has been turned way up in
here, supposedly to keep the machines cool, but somehow seeing your breath in
the air adds to the frosty theme of the Fifth Hell. Upon closer inspection, it
can be seen that all of this hodgepodge of equipment forms a half-circle
originating on the back wall. There, the metal-encased torso of a man looks
half-frozen into the wall... at least until he moves.

don't like to see their breath in the air while eating). The round table has a
clear plasticrete top, etched on the reverse side with a baphomet, a demon's
face, at its center. This is held up by a single central support, a heavy
column of plastic that looks like an icicle. The overstuffed booth bench is
made of blue synth-leather. The translucent walls allow you to see intact
humans and metahumans frozen in the smokey "ice." A plastic-and-glass
stalactite dangling from the ceiling is actually a  combination lamp and white
noise generator, and RJ-715 datapoint in the plasticrete wall provides Matrix
access.

   The sounds of the DJ farther down the spiralling staircase rack your skull
in hypnotic rhythm.  The glass stairs move farther down the spiral to a well
lit, colorful, place below.  The walls lining the stairs are covered in
ceramic eyes that glisten from the dance lights that hit them at regular
intervals.

   The Seventh Circle of Dante's Inferno is a very hip place to be, a hangout
for many of the rich and famous, and the media moguls.  There is always a DJ
spinning the tracks here keeping the music on the plate 24/7/365.25.  The
floor is made of glass, and has lights mounted inside that move in rhythm with
the music.  The walls are mirrors, and the lights above spin rapidly to the
music.

   The mirror covered walls sharply reflect the lights that flash against them
in rapid succession, in sync with the tracks being played by the resident
master DJ, DJ Infernis.  This is the level where the hippest of the hip, the
cream of the elite, the greatest of the great hang out to be seen at.  Hiding
in the shadows are talented bouncers who watch for any signs of papparazzi who
don't have clearance to be at this level.

the novahot and fresh rhythms that the famous are the first to hear.  His
tracks are used by DJ's continent wide, and are heard here months before they
are ever heard at less elite places like Club Penumbra and the Epicenter.  The
walls are covered in mirrors, so that the staff of Dante's can see everything
in here, to spot a papparazzi or an unauthorized fanboy or girl trying to get
a peek at the famous.

Name:	The Ninth Hell
Desc:$
   You are approaching the center of the Ninth Circle, where a large bar is
set up to serve the shadier clientele of Dante's Inferno.  Here you can find
many things of the legal and quasi-legal categories, and you can find johnsons
representing most, if not all of the major megacorporations.  To the criminal
element, this place is considered neutral ground, and it is considered bad
form to violate that neutrality with violence.

Desc:$
   The Bottom of the Abyss is a bar that is sunk into the rest of the cavern
that the Ninth Circle was built out of.  Deep underground, this bar serves a
vast variety of the criminal underworld of Seattle.  The bar is SOTA, with
every form of bartending technology embedded into the bar, giving the
bartender, Phobia, the ability to serve a lot of crooks at once. A very
expensive trid unit is embedded in an outcrop overhead, humming softly.

Desc:$
   A large cavern has been carved out of many layers of bedrock deep under
Seattle, to make the Ninth Level of Dante's.  Stalagmites in the ceiling are
actually real as parts of this cavern were once a deep air pocket beneath the
earth.  Music fills the air, people move about, mingling and cutting deals.
This is where many deals that affect the lives of the city are made, secret
deals that connect the criminal underground with the upper echelons of the
corporate world.

passageways, private rooms where many a deal are made, in the corporate world
and in the underworld.  The criminal underworld has a silent agreement that
this be neutral territory, as it is valuable in the strategies of every major
player in Seattle.  Here a shadowrunner can find a top of the line Johnson
looking for top of the line runners, and a decker can hide from those whose
systems he is compromising.

music, DJ Infernis coming through speakers under the floors pulsate in a
hypnotic rhythm that creates temporal hallucinations if you stare at it too
long.  Here the movers and shakers in the criminal underground and in the
corporate upper tier make their dirty deals.  Shadowrunners find the Johnsons
of the highest calibre here, as the ones down here are looking for the best of

   The Ninth circle of Dante's is the place to be to make deals or to find
anything illegal or criminal, or to simply relax with the elite of the
criminal underground.  The Ninth circle is neutral territory, so it is not
uncommon to see Yakuza discussing matters peacefully with Mafia upper crust.
The circle is built in the interior of a real underground cavern, with some
areas cut into the bedrock.  In the center of the cavern is a bar, selling
much in the way of consumables.

The private booths are used by the elite of the criminal underground, by
Johnsons meeting with runner teams, by organized crime cutting deals, and by
corporations buying off officials, and many other shady operations.  This is
the place for paydata, and this is the place to make a name for yourself.

Name:	The Ninth Hell
Desc:$
   The northeastern corner of the Ninth Circle is underneath a large
collection of stalagmites, some of them near enough to the floor of the level
to where a troll or giant would have to duck.  A passageway northeast leads to
a BBS center, where a terminal connects to Shadowland.

Name:	Alcove
Desc:$
   Several terminals are lined up, with an interface to allow non-deckers to
interact on the Shadowland system.  The alcove glows with the green glow of
green monochrome CRT's, as the deckers who set up this system had an affinity
with old-style Unix tty style terminals.  The table they are lined up on is
made of a midnight black marble, and only the sharpest knives get to etch
graffiti on it.

Desc:$
   The long line of Shadowland system terminals ends here, where the marble
table is pushed into the bedrock walls.  The dull green color from the
terminals is thick here, where the light from the club is unseen.  Benches
allow access to the terminals.  An RJ-715 dataport is in the wall here,
allowing connection to the matrix.

   The lights are on whenever motion is in the room or has been in the room
within the past 20 minutes, automatically illuminating whatever dark and shady

white noise generator, to keep listening devices from hearing anything that
goes on here.  Considering that this is a corporate and organized crime
meeting place, a lot of money goes into keeping this place secure and free of

brightest lit one is where the elevator is at this moment.  The music
resonates around you, creating an echo effect reminiscient to the tales of the
screaming noises in the caves of Pandaemonia.

Desc:$
   A large dark red colored iron door covered in skulls and designs depicting
the decapitation and dismembering of many unfortunate souls separates you from
the elevator shaft behind the door.  Up above it, are several red numbers
shaped like bones, reading, ^RG^n, ^RB1^n, ^RB2^n, ^RB3^n, ^RB4^n, ^RB5^n, ^RB6^n, ^RB7^n, ^RB8^n, ^RB9^n.  The

Desc:$
   Inside the elevator, the music doesn't stop, as tracks from DJ Infernis
resonate in the small acoustically engineered space, with a strobe light
switching between blue and red patterns that make your sense of time distort.
A panel is set up here with several buttons to tell you what button goes
where.  A sign which translates the buttons to the more well known level names
sits above the panel.

Name:	Entrance to Dante's Inferno, Underground
Desc:$
   A rather basic entranceway, with a door and security cameras scans and
records every individual who walks past this door.  More paranoid types may
prefer attempting to get past Grog Tenderfoot and Nolan, as these scanners
look bleeding edge state-of-the-art.  The loud screeching sound of music from
the inside of Dante's reverberates through the halls.

Desc:$
   A rather heavily used garage, despite the fresh paint smell that coincides
with the brimstone smell of Dante's Inferno, already oil stains smear the
concrete floor, dark patches of black against the fluctuating red glow that
illuminates the lot.  A ramp curves upwards to the front of the nightclub,
while an entranceway leads into the Second Hell.

   The garage curves northeast to west here, hugging the outer wall of the
infamous Dante's Inferno nightclub.  A blood red glow fills the air,
fluctuating rhythmically, occasionally interrupted by the headlights of
someone's car.  A devilishly evil looking graffiti mural covers the south
wall, consisting of an eastern dragon toasting a modern city in flames.

   The ramp circles around the southern edge of Dante's Inferno, and leads
downwards into a parking lot that circles the Second Hell.  The smell of
brimstone seems to thicken a bit as you move downwards, while the smell of
smog replaces it as you go back up towards the surface.  The parking lot is
lit with a blood red glow that fluctuates in luminocity.  Some graffiti,
indecipherable is painted on the wall in orange.
