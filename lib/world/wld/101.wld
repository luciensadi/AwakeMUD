   You walk up a set of steps, past a door. You see a huge cybered Troll
guarding the entrance. The halls are decorated with graffiti murals of various
freedom fighters including a very impressive one of Dunkelzahn with one of
Lemmy next to it and another of Malcolm X just below those two.

Name:	Melvak's Manor
Desc:$
   A fabulous Victorian-Era manor, refit to modern creature comforts.  This
place has a very large wide-screen trideo set, a pirated cable feed, and a
full bar with everything imaginable to drink, alcoholic, and non.  There is a
very large kitchen here with a refrigerator full of food, and drink.  Very
large troll-sized couches line the living room, and there is a large piasma
rug between the largest couch and the trideo set. A nine-speaker stereo system
is here, with a console above the trideo set, and speakers spaced throughout
the living room for maximum acoustic effect.

   This little roadway branches off of Clooney Avenue, and leads to a fairly
small studio apartment building. It looks relatively new, having been built
recently by the Orkish crews in a beautification program. Just down the road
you see the single, brown colored apartment building. The street itself seems
a little bit cleaner and more well-kept than the rest of the Ork Underground.
Signs sit on both sides of the street, reading in hunter green letters:
^gClooney Ave. Apartments^n.

   You stand at the door to the lobby of Clooney Ave. Apartments. Only a few
pieces of stray paper, and an occasional empty bottle of Grimms Whiskey litter
the area, but otherwise it seems somewhat clean. The building itself looks
well-maintained with the brown paint and dark yellow trim showing few signs of
wear and tear, and appearing relatively new. A large wooden door, obviously
made to accommodate trolls or even larger metahumans, sits atop 2 concrete
stairs. Windows on each side of the door give a faint glimpse of the greenish
decor of the lobby.

Name:	The lobby
Desc:$
   You step into the lobby. This room itself looks more like a type of waiting
room, a couple rather cheap chairs, and a mid-quality couch sit in the room
with tables spaced in between them. Ashtrays sit on the tables, filled with
cigarette butts. Dark green carpet, and lightly green tinted walls make up the
color scheme. Another large, usually open door sits to the west of the room
with 'Manager' printed on the window of it... Probably the place to go if you
wanted to rent an apartment. To the north, you see a laundry room with washers
and dryers, but also a large vending machine. To the east a semi-long hallway
extends, lined with doors leading into the various apartments.

room, covered in paperwork and various office supplies, with a computer on the

the name "Rob Bryner" on it. 2 cheap chairs, resembling those of the lobby,
sit on the visitors side of the desk. As is expected, a very comfortable
looking office chair is on the other side for the manager to use. File
cabinets sit on either side against the back wall, and just slightly obstruct
the large window in the center.

scheme. The smell of laundry detergent fills the air, and small pieces of lint
drift across the linoleum floor. On the right side of the room a large vending
machine covers the wall, dispensing both snacks and beverages.

stairwell bolted to it.

Name:	Stairwell to the top floor
Desc:$
   You stand at the bottom half of the stairwell to the top floor. It's
nothing extravagent at all, concrete steps being guided upwards by black,
steel rails. The stairwell itself seems much longer than you'd expect for only
going up a single level, due to the higher ceilings in accommodation of
trolls. The walls themselves are also simply concrete, with the occasional
crack and chip sighted in them. Generally deteriorating an otherwise 'ok'
looking apartment building, this still seems slightly above what you'd expect
out of the Ork Underground.

floor. While the amount of flickering or dead lights is slightly less up here,
the walls also have more scratches and peels in the paint. Apartment doors
once again continue to line against the walls. You also notice that the
temperature of this hallway seems noticeably warmer than the downstairs,
though it's not overwhelming.

Name:	Apartments hallway
Desc:$
   The hallway stretches westward, maintaining it's green theme. Small
lightbulbs run down the length of it. They don't seem to be terribly bright,
but only 1 is not working properly. The hallway stays fairly lit, none the
less. Wooden doors painted over in dark green sit on either side of the
hallway. Bronze colored markings on the doors indicate which apartment is
which: ^y3B^n to the north, ^y4B^n to the south.

   The hallway comes to an end here. The back wall lights the remainder of the
hallway, with a single, semi-decorative light mounted on it. The last two
apartments also reside here, the bronze colored markings on the door shining
vaguely brighter than the rest from the wall-mounted light. To the north lies
^y5B^n, and to the south is ^y6B^n.

This apartment looks gutted apart from the hammock and simple closet in the corner. The floor is covered in dirt and you have doubts to the sanity of the occupant due to the firepit in the center of the apartment, the broken open animal bones in the corner, and the sharp blood splattered rocks that litter the room.

   This apartment is somewhat cheaply built in comparison to the rest of the
building, but it's more than adequate for anybody less than troll in size. The
single small room appears to have recently been touched up. The cheap green
carpet, the standard for this building, has been replaced with nicer, properly
installed grey shag (padding and all). Like most of the other units in this
building, the walls are too thin to block out the neighbors' trid, but at
least they've recieved a fresh coat of paint.
   The kitchen has seen a little care, too. The small stove and sink are
identical to other units in the building, but some of the standard cabinets
have been removed to make room for a regular-sized fridge. The real stand out
feature of this unit is the bathroom. Instead of a stand up shower, this
apartment features a tub just large enough for a troll to enjoy a bubble bath.
The rest of the bathroom is to form for the building, with a toilet, small
sink, and mirror/medicine cabinet combo squeezed into the remaining space.

You know the apartment is small, but its not like you could tell by looking at it: Tapestries make fabric walls and dividers. The main compartment is divided into two sections, a sort of sitting sleeping/futon section and a small shrine-like setup, incense burning, hookah smouldering and various dog-related fetishes, necklaces, and paintings hang from the ceiling and a half-stack marshall amplifier. The guitar sits next to the amp, it's montego black finish glinting in the neon and candle light.

   Cockroach Alley is considered a more middle class section of the Ork

created by chiseling into the bedrock under the city of Seattle.  It looks
like a lot of work was put into making these places livable, as they often
have electricity, running water, and even pirated trid cable in some cases.

a guard a ways in, as you can see a very large silhouette, probably a troll in
the darkness.

   Clooney Avenue was a part of the old Seattle, long before a long forgotten
earthquake submerged the section of city that eventually became parts of the
Ork Underground.  There appears to be some sort of reconstruction project in
the works out here, as orkish crews take shifts to rebuild some of the old
Victorian era houses that once gave Clooney Avenue a quaint charm.  Graffiti
covers the fences that block off the construction projects, and a few signs
crediting Yamatetsu for the funding of the projects can be seen on the walls.

#10156
Name:	Clooney Avenue
Desc:$
   Clooney Avenue's reconstruction project extends southward down about a
block, as houses are being rebuilt by orkish crews, in a beautification
program.  Here Clooney begins to narrow, as ruins on both sides start to close
in, becoming even more narrower northward, past Old Sewer.

Name:	Tunnel
Desc:$
   Just to the southwest of you is the opening to the tunnel, at an
intersection in the Ork Underground.  The air has a thick musty smell to it,
like stale cheese.  There is a trickle of water running through here from a
nearby grate, and a regular drip from the ceiling, which is about three meters
high.

#10158
Name:	Tunnel
Desc:$
   A musty tunnel, not very high, only about three meters tall, and not very
wide, only about four meters wide.  It is just enough height and girth for a
troll to comfortably travel alone through.  The air has a musty smell, like
cheese that has been left outside two weeks too long.  The ceiling drips from
condensation off of the thick concrete, and water trickles in through small
grates, barely large enough for a small rat or kitten to crawl through.

#10159
Name:	A dark tunnel
Desc:$
   A musty tunnel, with barely enough room for a troll to comfortably walk
through.  The tunnels height is just enough that said troll would not have to
duck, but he wouldn't be able to play on a pogo stick either.  The air smells
of rotten cheese and sour milk.  There are occasional metahuman and human
bones seen along the path.

Name:	A dark tunnel
Desc:$
   The tunnel becomes very cramped moving farther east, though a troll could
pass through if he ducked and walked sideways.  The air is musty, with a
chemical smell in the air, and there is much humidity, with water condensing
off the ceiling which curves downwards going east.

Name:	Dunkelzahn's Temporary Arena
Desc:$
   Here is a place where killing is allowed (I think.)  You are surrounded by
a great deal of dragons and dracoforms circling and watching, rooting for
whatever side looks like it is most likely to win.
   The exit down leads back to Tacoma.

   You are surrounded by a brilliant white light.  Alien faces look at you and
probe you in and out.  Tanks with human clones and parts surround you. All
around you is a happy easy feeling, and you hear a voice repeating in your
head "we are only doing this to save your planet."
