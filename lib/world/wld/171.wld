Desc:$
   A long corridor, sterile, clean polished white tile covers the walls and
floor. The ceiling is lined with high-grade fluorescent lighting, keeping a
bright, yet glareless cast of light over the corridor. Northwards is a clean
room, heavily guarded. Plastered across the walls are several signs, which
read along the lines of "^RAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY!^N" and the old favourite,
"^RTRESSPASSERS WILL BE SHOT ON SIGHT, CHECKED FOR SIGNS OF LIFE, THEN SHOT
AGAIN IF NECESSARY!^N". Apparently they mean business here.

Name:	Action Computers and Electronics, End of Counter
Desc:$
   Surrounding you is a large array of aisles filled with every sort of
electronics trinket you can imagine.  There are displays set up, in a corner,
some fat human who looks like he is zonked on some medication of some kind is
hoisting computer cases up onto an upper shelf.  Behind the counter is a man
in a pinstripe suit, with gray hair and bright blue eyes.

Name:	The Service Pit of A High-Tech Elevator Shaft
Desc:$
The service pit of the Mitsuhama elevator is much dirtier than the shaft
above, owing no doubt to the amount of junk that filters down from passersby
dropping their things into the crack between the car and the shaft wall. A
pair of massive coiled shock absorbers juts up from the ground here, enormous
technological stalagmites designed to reduce the lethality of sudden elevator
drops.
