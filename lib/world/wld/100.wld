Name:	^W(^cIMMHQ^W)^C A Grand Laboratory
Desc:$
   Pristine polymer countertops and gleaming metal fume hoods line the walls
of this well-outfitted laboratory. The floor, a freshly-waxed tile, gives off
the faintest scent of lemon, offsetting the otherwise-sterile atmosphere.

Desc:$
   Long, open lanes stretch to the west, solidly-built targets standing at
various distances along them to challenge even the most skilled shooter. To
the east, a target is surrounded by helper automatons that will return fire if
the target is attacked.

Desc:$
   Away from the open spaces of the main reading room, you find yourself in an
area of comfortable silence. Motes of dust drift languidly through the air
here, glimmering in the warm light of the incandescent bulbs above. The great
mahogany shelves that line these aisles seem to deal exclusively with the
Hermetic tradition.

Desc:$
   Absolutely packed with dusty tomes, this magical library seems to hold
every secret in the world-- if only you had the time to find them. Between the
large oaken reading tables stands a white marble pedestal, upon which sits a
pristine copy of Richard Bartle's "Designing Virtual Worlds."

   Eschewing the stacks of printed materials that entrance the Hermetic mages
to the north, this rotunda is instead devoted to paintings and sculptures of
the aspects of various Shamanic totems. Nestled amongst the iconography are
doors, each leading to a reserveable room to build your Shamanic lodge in.

enormous. Neat rows of network cabling split and weave amongst the racks. The

may not be the healthiest room to spend your time in.
