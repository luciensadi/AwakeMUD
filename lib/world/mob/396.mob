This dark haired, dark eyed man peers at you through glasses perched

fingered hands wave eloquently with the flow of his voice.  His clothes are a
washed-dull black and non-descript.  He rarely leaves his seat in which he
slumps forward with rounded shoulders over his work.

A ground controller is communicating with various personnel around the site. 

~
LookDesc:$
He appears quite busy, and is, as his job consists of keeping in communication
with all of the employees on the ground around the site and keeping everything
running smoothly, errors tend to cause accidents and those tend to cost lives.
He swiftly scans between displays and has a stream of updates coming in over
the radio, which he then analyzes and gives out commands to others.

Name:	an air controller
RoomDesc:$
An air controller is busy with the radio here. 

~
LookDesc:$
With the swiftness of someone who has been at it for years, with plenty of
experience and practice to show for it, this air controller works the radio
frequencies and dances between receiving transmissions and broadcasting them.
His job is to keep any mishaps from happening once something leaves the
ground, and while it's in the air it's entirely his responsibility to keep
them accident free, though once they touch down he could care less, that's
someone elses job.
