An uninstalled adrenal pump is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
This is a small, muscular sac implanted in the lower abdominal cavity and 
connected to each of the two suprarenal, or adrenal, glands. When dormant, the 
pump serves as a reservoir for adrenaline and noradrenaline. When activated, 
the sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrates into the bloodstream. Stress 
and other emotional states such as anger, fear or lust will also activate the 
pump.~

The recipient of Cat's Eyes receives a new set of replacement eyes, vat-grown

enhances the user's night vision. The number of light-sensitive rods and 
detail-enhancing cones in the eye also increase. Like the eyes of a cat, this 
bioware incorporates a mirror-like organ in the cornea that reflects light 
toward the retina. Under low-light conditions, these eyes seem to be reflective 
and to glow in the dark. The pupils are also slitted like a cat's eyes, to 
increase the amount of light received. These eyes perceive color.~

Similar to the Suprathyroid, the Metabolic Arrester is a regulating gland grown 
on top of the thyroid. Under conditions where the body seems to be suffering 
from massive trauma, as measured by a severe drop in blood pressure and the 
presence of high levels of endorphins, the Metabolic Arrester supersedes the 
thyroid's metabolic functions, drastically decreasing the body's metabolic 
rate. As the heart and breathing rates slow to minimal levels and the body's 
temperature drops, the character takes on a death-like pallor. The lowered body 
functions help stave off the effects of trauma and lower nanite loss.~

sugars). The altered metabolism produces more energy and effectively 
supercharges the recipient. With the higher levels of energy available, 
characters with a Suprathyroid have a tendency toward hyperactivity.
