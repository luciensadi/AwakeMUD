RoomDesc:$
A SOTA Trideo Unit is embedded above the bar.~
LookDesc:$
The Trideo Unit above the bar probably costs more than your average house.
It's more than big enough for everyone in the Ninth Circle to see, and clear
enough that even those sitting at the bar can tell what's going on. Though
only those close to the bar could ever hear it, as the music drowns it out
beyond a very close range.

RoomDesc:$
A jet black credstick is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
This credstick is unlike any standard credstick in the UCAS or Tir Tairngire.
Unlike being made of a steel, plastic, silver, titanium or emerald color,
It is made of a very hard plastic, completely black in color, with a polish.
It contains the CIN (Citizen's Identification Number) of a Cascadian
citizen, with full data on their biology, a copy of their genome, and
trideo picture data of what they look like.  It also can carry an amount
of nuyen, and a currently undefined currency type, updatable with a memory
flash.
The credstick is the same size as standard credsticks.              ^n

A blue sheath covered in embroidered runes sits here.~

The runes are ancient, similar to sperethiel, probably a language spoken by
elves even more ancient than whatever culture spoke Sperethiel.  The sword
sheath is colored blue, the color of an early night sky.  The sheath is put
together with excellent craftsmanship and care.

Keywords:	oro'quiel sword ancient elven kri'isen power
Name:	Oro'quiel
RoomDesc:$
A sword of perfect design, etched in elven runes, lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The sword has a strange feel to it, as if it is alive. The metal is polished
to a mirror shine, in fact it shines brighter than it should.  A set of runes
are etched into the metal dip along the center.  The guard is made of a blue
metal with a strange sheen to it, with a blue jewel with a moving mist inside
of it at the center of the guard.  The handle is tightly wrapped leather,
colored black.  The hilt is the same blue metal as the guard, and has a rune
etched on the bottom.  The sword's balance feels better than the most well put
together mundane sword that can be found, and the edge is razor sharp, almost
like a monofilament edge.

A silver pendant with an eight pointed star on it lies here.~
LookDesc:$
The silver has an odd colour to it, a cast of almost a white glow but the
sheen is definitely silver, untarnished.  The eight point star, made of two
converging squares is also called the Ki'ronyx star, and was the symbol of the
8 kingdoms of the Confederacy of Tirlannon, a democratic elven nation that
vanished aeons ago.
