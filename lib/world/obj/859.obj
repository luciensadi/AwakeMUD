This is a small, muscular sac implanted in the lower abdominal cavity and

the sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrates into the bloodstream. Stress

Similar to the Suprathyroid, the Metabolic Arrester is a regulating gland grown 
on top of the thyroid. Under conditions where the body seems to be suffering 
from massive trauma, as measured by a severe drop in blood pressure and the 
presence of high levels of endorphins, the Metabolic Arrester supersedes the 
thyroid's metabolic functions, drastically decreasing the body's metabolic 
rate. As the heart and breathing rates slow to minimal levels and the body's 
temperature drops, the character takes on a death-like pallor. The lowered body 
functions help stave off the effects of trauma and lower nanite loss.~

supercharges the recipient. With the higher levels of energy available,

By altering an individual's sweat glands, specially designed pheromones may be 
released, dispersing into the area and subtly influencing others. These 
tailored pheromones are full-spectrum, boosting all pheromone scents, not just 
sex-oriented ones. Pheromone augmentation continues to function even in the 
person is in the presence of another person with Tailored Pheromones.
^n
Pheromones are species-specific; though human and metahuman pheromones are 
similar, pheromones will have no effect on non-humanoid creatures. Tailored 
Pheromones are designed to affect all metatypes equally.~

The metahuman liver is the body's main organ for catabolism, or the breakdown 
of complex substances. As such, it is the first line of defense against 
potentially toxic compounds and drugs. The Toxin Extractor is a specially 
cultivated cluster of cells implanted in the liver to greatly improve the 
efficiency and to expand the spectrum of catabolic activity. Potential toxins 
that make their way into the bloodstream are filtered out in the liver, and 
with the aid of the extractor they are broken down into harmless fragments and 
then expelled.~

When the editor is voluntarily triggered, the individual is no longer subject

neither mental damage nor fatigue can render the character unconscious.~

Thus, more data can be sent from and received by the brain in a shorter period

LookDesc:$
A Trauma Damper is a clump of specialized receptors, implanted at the base of the thalamus, near the midbrain. Upon receiving sensory information indicating fatigue, pain or physical trauma, the damper triggers the release of concentrated endorphins and enkephalins — naturally produced opiates and painkillers. These substances do not aid in repairing the trauma, but they may keep the user alive and conscious long enough for him to receive medical help.~
