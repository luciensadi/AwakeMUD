This suit of light armor provides protection at most places throughout the

have been slightly modified, with some of the armor plattings replaced with a
lighter polymer to reduce its over all weight but offering a bit less

The Heckler & Koch CAWS (Close Assault Weapon System) is an automatic shotgun
design that was originally intended to be for the US Navy program of the same
name. The intention was to provide a more adequate solution for close quarter
engagements. The design is bullpup in layout, with the magazine behind the
trigger and has a ceramic frame to reduce its weight. The CAWS fires standard
12 gauge (19.5 x 76B) shells, allowing high commonality with other shotguns.

RoomDesc:$
A large pistol is lying here.~
LookDesc:$
Replacing both the USP IV and the Pz M136, the USP-V Mod 0 is a highly
advanced pistol for the active combat sections. Building on the old Mark 23
"SOCOM" pistol, the USP V Mod 0 follows in the same tradition, only
differently. When it became apparent that the Pz M136 was incapable of meeting
the needs of the SSG, Heckler & Koch engineers went back to the drawing
boards. What they came up with may be the most advanced heavy pistol in the
world. The weapon is blowback operated, as standard in all HK pistols. The
slide locks back when the weapon has been emptied, allowing simply for the
firer to slam another magazine and pull slightly, and the slide will chamber
the first round. Engineers have modified the slide system to also self-clean
the action, preventing dirt from fouling up the weapon, and making it highly
reliable in almost all enviroments. A polymer outer frame is colored in olive
drab, and is designed to break up the outline of the weapon.
