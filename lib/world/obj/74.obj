A classic design that placed Mortimer on the map, these heavy, waterproofed
coats are reminiscent of 20th-century naval greatcoats. Though apparently
thick with wool and lined with silk, most of the greatcoat's weight comes from
heavy ballistic fabric and semi-rigid plates disguised by the cut of the coat.
Greatcoats are waterproofed and chemically resistant to the "hard rain" common
in many urban sprawls.
