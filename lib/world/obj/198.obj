A high-powered video projector is mounted here, projecting onto the wall.~

The projector is done up in a very sleek looking silver case that is almost
bullet like. There are a large number of ports on the back to support any kind
of monitor source you could think of. The panel reads 12,000 lumens insuring
that you'll get a great picture even in a rather bright room. The packaging
boasts that it can display well over 3 million colors so why not fire it up
and try her out?

plastic plants. One part of the tank has a thin lining of sand on it over a
hot plate. There is also a small dish that has some water in it in one corner
of the tank. Inside the tank is a Rosy Boa that appeares to be about 2 and a
half feet long and a dark brown color with red accents. It sliters around
occasionally looking at you with great interest. A small white mouse scuries
about looking terrified knowing its time is almost up.

rapid fire mechanisms. Within the head are two high velocity chain guns that
feed off an internal ammo supply. The Mech is Red and White and looks almost
like a giant medic. It's rather ironic in a sense. Mounted on each of its
shoulders are large Gatling Guns which are connected to its backpack. On the
backpack is the word ASSAULT AT-001. This is the special edition version of

distinctive feature of this mech is he lacks the standard backpack that all

He doesn't seem to carry any weapon but knowing the Mech Crew he most likely
has one hidden somewhere. The most notable difference between this mech and
all the others is that he has two mini-visors that look more like eyes. On his

shape of this Mech is hidden under the massive cloak he wears. The bottom of

you can barely make out the shape of what looks like the weapon he uses and a
similar one on the opposing side. His visor is locked in a constant state of
blood red symbolizing his always present desire to kill. On each of his
shoulders is a large gold insignia with the letters MC inside it. On the back
of the cloak in red lettering is the word APOCALYPSE AL-001. This mech is cast
out of pewter making it rather heavy. The box it comes in is quite large and
features a stand for the mech that places it admist the broken ruins of a
building the large planet splitter cannon in its hands.

An exact replica of the Knight Center each of the three spires has been

bottom is "Collectors Edition Series One" followed by an identification number
authenticating it as a real Ares product and not some cheap knock-off.

A large sniper rifle rests on the floor looking as imposing as ever.~
LookDesc:$
This is a heavy sniper rifle. Coming standard with a high powered scope, sound
supressor, and bipod, this beastly rifle could drop an elephant at 1000 yards.
Its effective range is 1500 yards and the recoil is also minimized. The 500
grain .75 caliber round, packed with powder, tops out at 5000 fps and will
decimate everything. A warning on the barrel states "Caution!!! This gun
should be used by ONLY superior marksmen and if used by an under-trained
individual, it could kill them. Ares is not responsible for any deaths." The
magazines for this weapon are low capacity for each round weighs so much. The
normal capacity is 5 though this one seems to have been altered to use 15.
There is a sling attached to it for carrying. The bipod is a ZZ-Turbo made of
carbon fiber and coated in latex.

A clean looking barbwire cord sits here.~

This sterile length of barbwire cord seems to be wrapped and bound together in
upon itself, the opening of which is just large enough to carefully slide ones
hand through. To understand pain, one must know pain, one must experience
pain, one must become one with pain... And then carefully disinfect the wounds
with neosporin, or maybe some 'tussen. No pain, no gain!

This oldschool Russian gas mask is easily 60+ years old and seems better
equiped on a costume than an actual soldier in the field. It offers literally
no NBC protection and will most likely get you killed if you attempt to use it
for chemical protection. The entire unit consists of a mask worn over the
entire head and face, and has two plastic eye visors that hamper ones vision
quite a bit, as well as the canister filter and nozzel attachment portion
located near the mouth and nose. Quite ineffective, unless you're stomping
around the apocalypse.
