An ancient, leather-bound tome lies here, with runes embossed on the cover.~
LookDesc:$
The book looks like it was carefully made in times long since gone, with runes
embossed on the cover.  The runes look vaguely like letters and words of
Sperethiel, the "Elven" language of Tir Tairngire, and there is a lock
embedded in the book, ancient, made with etched gold. The lock is unlocked,
and the book has some dogeared parchment pages inside, covered in small runes,
of the same language as the cover of the book.
