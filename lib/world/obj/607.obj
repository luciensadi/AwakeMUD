little piece of technology is for controlling the weather inside the training
area. Because of the time and money that has gone into it, the controls are
able to simulate rainfall with the same purified water that is pumped through
the stream, and even create a cold fog with dimmed lights to help those
training learn to fight under adverse conditions. There are also buttons that
control the paint of the wall, with various pre-set "times" that can be
brought up with a few presses to mimic any time of day and almost any climate
with air conditioning and heat to match as well as possible. A lot of effort
to put forth to an area that only seems to have one bedroom.

With enough grease covering this thing to keep a car running for at least a few hundred years or so, healthy isnt the word one would associate with this piece of food. Delicious? Yes. With a whopping thirteen pounds of rib-eye and other assorted meats crammed into the roll and cheese smothered upon it, hunger could be easily defeated for any metahuman just by glancing in its general direction. Condiments abound on this sandwich, with fried onions, sauteed green peppers, mushrooms, hot sauce, ketchup, mayo,
 dijon mustard, and many other things a man could ask for on a sandwich, slathered all over the insides of the roll. And what seemed at first like a heavenly light around it, one would notice soon that it wasnt traveling towards the sandwich, but rather away from it, reflected by the massive amounts of grease. To add to this heartburn-inducing mess, thick strips of bacon have been wrapped about the entire sandwich itself, and the roll has even been deep fried to add to the delicious tastiness. To any real 
man, this tasty morsel would be called a culinary masterpiece--a true delicacy that is fit for a meal of the GODS!

This massive anvil looks to be the piece that is most often worked on by
whomever runs this place. Hard, dense metal has been worked masterfully to

the pieces created on it. The horn that curves up from one end tapers more
dramatically than a typical anvil, showing that this is meant to be used on
pieces of variable sizes and can be used for working with fine detailing.
Along one side of the huge piece are Elder Futhark runes, spelling out Uruz
Raidho Thurisaz Othala Raidho for those who might actually know the alphabet
or have access to the matrix.

A small pouch with several straps is piled up here.~
LookDesc:$
With a simple one-wire release on this pouch, it offers quick access to all
items within-handy for those times when you find yourself in the middle of a
warzone. Several straps along the underside secure the pouch snugly against
the user if worn on the thigh or waist, and can be attached together to allow
one to wear it under the shoulder. Lightweight and fairly durable for the
material it is made from, this little trusty pouch will stay with you in the
long run.

A simple gray passkey lies here.~

Used to open maglocks, this keycard is usually slid through a keycard reader
or held nearby the lock itself, with an RF tag hidden in the card giving off a
signal to the door for it to be unlocked. What this opens? Who knows. Many
places have maglocks in this day and age, so there are several choices for one
to try this on.

Name:	a custom Colt Double Eagle pistol
RoomDesc:$
a large handgun was left here.~
LookDesc:$
The Colt Double Eagle was created back in the 1990's, but came late to the market as more 'modern' pistols took to sleeker and more compact designs, and so most gun enthusiasts considered it outdated with its heavy, all-steel construction. This particular model is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, made specifically for combat with its combined accuracy and stopping power against human targets. This one uses the double-action trigger type with a ring hammer and fixed dovetail sights. The gun itself is a 
recoil-operated, locked breech pistol and uses the Browning-type locking system made famous by the Colt M1911 pistol and uses several lightweight polymers to make up the majority of the frame, along with a steel slide and chrome-plated barrel to make up a reliable, accurate, and light firearm while still retaining enough weight to be useful enough for clubbing someone across the dome with it when ammo has run out. The select fire switch flips between the Safe and Semi-Automatic positions, but strangely loo
ks to be able to be set to a third, non-labeled option.

The gun's handle seems to have been molded to a particular person, with the
grooves fitted for what seems to be either human or elf-sized fingers. Near
the base of the grip is a small stylized sword blade with straight quillions,
forming a slanted capital T.

RoomDesc:$
^nA massive handcannon lying here threatens to crush through the floor.~
LookDesc:$
Created off of the revolver frame, this handgun uses a short, three-round clip inserted near the rear of the gun. As for why it only contains three cartridges, after skimming over the engraving painstakingly carved across the side of the barrel, the reason becomes clear for this 'shortcoming'. It reads: The Magnum Opus 'Hellbringer' .666 caliber handgun. You read that correctly, .666 caliber. As for the weapon's design, it is best described as a large, hefty brick soldered to a handgun grip, its large size
 only somewhat offsetting the massive recoil the ammo delivers to its user. Across the sides, several engravings of flames and other infernal elements originate from the barrel and cover the entirety of the weapon, showing how lovingly handcrafted this weapon was. On top of all this, a secondary barrel underneath looks to be able to take a single shotgun round. 'Rumours' told of this weapon tell that it is better described as an anti-aircraft gun rather than a simple handgun, and stories of the fact that t
his handcannon comes 'standard' with anti-vehicular cartridges leaves little room for one to think otherwise. From the size of the bullets, the recoil on this weapon is a beast and can easily snap one's wrist bones if they aren't careful or using a weapon brace. And don't even think of firing this one-handed, as after snapping your wrist clean off, the gun itself will be embedded in your skull after it flies out of your hand. To make sure it is held with both hands, the designer made the weapon have a heav
y trigger pull beyond what normal weapons usually have so the strength from both arms were necessary for it to fire, and while this may make it a little less accurate, it has the added benefit of there being less accidental misfires as it's damn hard for the hammer to be released and fire on a random bystander, since it lacks any other kind of safety.
