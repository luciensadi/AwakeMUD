RoomDesc:$

LookDesc:$
Poi is a Hawaiian word for the primary Polynesian staple food made from the
corm of the kalo plant (known widely as taro). Poi is produced by mashing the
cooked corm (baked or steamed) to a highly viscous fluid. Water is added
during mashing and again just before eating, to achieve a desired consistency,
which can range from liquid to dough-like (poi can be known as two-finger or
three-finger, alluding to how many fingers you would have to use to eat it,
depending on its consistency). The bowl of poi was considered so important and
a sacred part of daily Hawaiian life that whenever a bowl of poi was uncovered
at the family dinner table, it was believed that the spirit of Ha-loa, the
ancestor of the Hawaiian people, was present. Because of that, all conflict
among family members had to come to an immediate halt.

baguette, in that it has a flaky crust with a soft, airy center like baguettes
in France. The crust of Louisiana French bread is very crispy--so much so that
it is difficult to eat without leaving crumbs.

This corset goes to show that you can look stylish, just so long as you don't
mind standing out in any and every situation with woefully mismatched
camouflage patterns. With all of the molded ribbing and lacing one would
expect to help strangle the wearers body into oddly proportioned perfection,
the low cut top is helpful for shoving the girls up on full display to draw
even more attention. Patches of kevlar have been sewn inbetween the materials
to offer some vague sense of protection, despite the fact the outfit doesn't
cover much of anything to begin with.
