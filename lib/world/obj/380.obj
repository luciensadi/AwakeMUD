A pair of black sunglasses made with metal frames are here.~
LookDesc:$
These sunglasses are mirrored on the outside with a chrome layer, and the
inside is slightly tinted with a layer of nano-fibre polymer, which acts as
mechanism for the thermographic vision function of the glasses.  That's right,
these glasses are thermographic it seems.  The frame is also crafted from
titanium alloy and seems to be hollow, possibly housing circuitry for the
gadgets.  A small mark on the side of the glasses, the logo possibly, acts as
a switch for the thermographics.
