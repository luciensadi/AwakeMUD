A long, form fitting black dress that reaches the wearer's ankles. A slit up
one side exposes the leg up to the hip, not only making the dress seductive,
but also allowing for ease of movement as well. The top half of the dress has
two bands that wrap around the upper arms, leaving the shoulders exposed. The
quality leather construction also gives a good bit of protection.
