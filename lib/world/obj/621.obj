tubes running the length of the butt stock and ending at an air snap-inlet
valve that connects to a scuba tank or external air source. When fired the
carbine draws air in through the inlet valve and into the firing chamber
itself, allowing it to fire its ammunition underwater. Positive overpressure
from the air source also ensures that no water is sucked in when it is fired,
while a built in purge valve forces any water out of it when the user is
changing clips.

recoil, as well as a select fire switch that allows it to fire either on
semi-automatic, three round bursts, or good old fashioned balls to the wall

Seriously..? Is this actually what it looks like? Yes, it is. Apparently
someone had the bright idea of lashing half a shark jaw to a length of carved
wood, using it as a handle for this makeshift weapon of terror. You really,
really, really don't want to find out what getting hit by this thing will do,
but on the other hand, you really, really, really wanna hit someone else with
it so you can find out. A few of the teeth are missing, but several dozen
still remain, so it's obviously been put to use before. A bit of blood is also
caked onto the bone and shark teeth, so that should be an indication as well.
