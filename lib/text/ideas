Daedalus (Jul 10) [ 2226] transfer of data to and from headware memory via the datajack perhaps with a computer presence required. then stealing data from headmemory would be neat say only if the victim is lying or unconscious this would give datalock a purpose
Starlight (Dec  5) [15800] Phones should pick up background noise.  Fragments of speech, gunfire, etc.
Lenny    (Dec 27) [  670] have shamanic masks included in reflection desc that get more and more prominent the more spells that someone is sustaining
Daedalus (Feb 28) [ 2204] speaker phones so that one room can converse with another room.
Daedalus (Mar  9) [ 2226] fire extinguishers that can be used on others to end flames caused by ignite flamethrower or any other fire that may be implemented later. i dont think this is something you should be able to use on yourself though
Pennywise (May 13) [ 2060] Put an order time on cars.  If we have to convince to import a program for a cyberdeck, we should have to convince someone to import an armored security vehicle as well.
Daedalus (May 23) [ 2226] it would be nice to be able to put money in containers
Quovley  (Jun  6) [ 2220] being able to sort programs installed on computers according to name, or Mp size or Rating
Ginwind  (Aug 23) [    0] Allow radio transmitting/receiving while rigging, when the vehicle you're rigging has a Radio installed into it.
Keikay   (Sep 18) [10129] languages for johnsons/shopkeepers. you can't get job/buy stuff if you fail language roll.
Daedalus (Nov 21) [    0] look front to look into the front of a vehicle from the back
Daedalus (Dec 10) [ 2226] the physical service service for elementals and nature spirits could be partially brought about with an emote command like vemote. in addition simple commands like get put and give would be nice. perhaps with any objects the spirits are holding dropping to the floor when the spirit returns to the metaplanes.
Goron    (Mar 23) [ 2087] make 'load #.programname' i.E. 'load 5.medic' work in the matrix, without it's not possible to reload the medic program if you have medic paydata 
Madigari (Apr 24) [42124] Make command to abort cooking for impatient people who don't have safe apartments to cook in, people who make program orders and cancel them or people who decide they're going to use their chips on a different program.
Johnny   (Apr 27) [17110] there should be a way to see maximums while choosing races,
Ace      (Jun 12) [24800] it would be nice if we could also assense spirit energy of spirits
Yuliya   (Jul 31) [32726] Things shouldn't be able to make death cries in silenced rooms.
Durban   (Sep 17) [    0] If a mob's shooting at me and I get into the car they should continue shooting at the car.
Madison  (Dec  5) [22673] It would be nice to be able to use a vehicle's gridguide through a remote control deck, even if you don't have a rig installed, but do have a datajack.
Tenpenny (Dec  6) [11467] A way to close/lock garages from inside vehicles
Raphael  (Jan 15) [ 9908] People shouting in the same room as someone on a phone should be heard on the other end of the line, unless the person near the shouting is using a cyberphone.
Daedalus (Jan 17) [ 2226] the vehicles in chargen room Driving: Vroom vroom, dukka dukka should either have a sign saying what vehicle is of what type or have them arranged by type (presently there is a luxury car first then a truck then a bike then 2 more cars then a bike then a car.) i recall no instance in which a new player has asked any questions about driving or vehicles and not asked what type of vehicle at least one of them are.
Sid      (Jan 23) [32303] Make the mud spam a twitch or similar social about as frequent as the ambient vehicles driving by outside on a player that has Wired Reflexes without a Reflex trigger. If for nothing more than a lol effect.
Yukina   (Apr 26) [ 2013] Yank command to disconnect people plugged into the matrix.
Tania    (Jun  9) [11407] could you make it that the vehicle decks give co-ords of the room the vehicle is in or a better location? there are a lot of generic rooms (garage ones) and a generic "a parking lot" doesn't give any hints. this is for those of us (me) with really bad memories. thank you. *hugs*
Urthor   (Nov 10) [32686] An ^Y(Active)^r tag for adept abilities that have only a single "level" much like other powers have the ^Y(level)^r tags to let an adept know at what level it is activated. It would make short work of having to guess at whether or not you really do have Smashing Blow or the other powers that fall under this category active, or simply trying to activate them again to figure it out.^n
Aetrian  (Jun  1) [11407] Riggers should be able to buy some drones and rigger gear in chargen.
Mavrick  (Jul 23) [    0] you should be able to rest while gridguide is working, everytime it switches a room you automatically dont rest anymore...
Bacchus  (Dec  8) [ 4457] How about that running multiplier for satyrs works as something that actually helps you get out of combat easier?
Spindrift (Feb  3) [ 4930] I think it would be nice if there were some way to order conjured spirits/elementals to emote/use socials and change position. It would be better if this did not use up a service. At present I suppose people can weave the actions of their pets/spirits/elementals into their own emotes, like issue a command and then the pet/spirit/elemental does whatever, but it would be nice for them to stand alone more.
Spindrift (Mar  5) [11407] An initiative command that rolls your initiative dice (without rerolling sixes), sums them, and adds your reaction. For dice runs.
Spindrift (May  2) [71075] Being able to ready fingertip compartments (for use with monowhips).
Siehera  (May 29) [    0] Some sort of indicator you can insert in your prompt reminding you you're dual-natured.
Spindrift (Jun 12) [    0] Astral stats are pretty screwy. I'm sure you're aware of this, just saying.
Siehera  (Aug  3) [29402] Not sure if this is a bug, but the Light spell doesn't make it so you can see in pitch black rooms.
Uktar    (Aug  5) [22670] Shady dealer should give you a general location of the area to find him when he mails you a alert for pickup I mean really what kind of cracked out dealer expects you to search him out over a 5 block radius.
Siehera  (Aug 10) [70306] a 'foci' or 'focus' command to see how many foci you have activated total
Beagan   (Oct 30) [18334] It would be handy if there was a 'slaughter' command, or similar, to coup de grace unconscious enemies and save a couple repeat typings of 'kill'
Beagan   (Oct 30) [18336] Introduce a 'fixer' NPC type, which helps you connect with Johnsons that you have already visited. Whenever you find a new Johnson and ask them for a job, the game keeps track; your character "knows" that Johnson, from then on. The next time you go to your fixer, and ask the fixer for jobs, he will tell you -which- of your "known" Johnsons have jobs available for you, so you don't have to run around in circles hitting the same places over and over with no result. You would still have to go explore and find new Johnsons before they get added to the fixer's list. Ex: (after climb two flights up an elevator shaft in Tacoma) "Got a job for me?" TraderVix: "And just who are you?" (climb back down. Later, at Dante's, I go up to the fixer...) "Hey, Oscar, know any jobs available?" Oscar (fixer): "TraderVix in West Tacoma told me he's looking for you." "Mugsy, over at the Pharoah Nightclub, has a 'networking opportunity' with your name on it." (etc.) If you wanna be really fancy, you could introduce a way to register your phone number and have the fixer NPC call you.
Spindrift (Nov  3) [11407] Make alcohol count as a drug from detox purposes.
Spindrift (Nov 11) [    0] Kinda random one: have bone lacing add to a character's weight in addition to weight carried.
Rex      (Nov 22) [32664] A mirror room or object in chargen so you can check your movement verbs and appearance as others see them. I imagine it would be set like a player, codewise, so the messages are sent to it, then echo back what it receives.
Anestasia (Dec  1) [ 2105] could the game have a Loan Star threat response? I mean that if you kill star officers you get pursued by harder and harder officers until they kill you or you hide from the Star for a period of time (say 3 MUD days or something)? At the very least maybe it could make them all agro against you for a while.
Onan     (Apr  4) [24502] combining ammo boxes like blank optical chips and cyberdeck parts
Mia      (Apr 10) [60573] A seperate command for subdue and kill, which will increase ease of combat and reduce having to spam "kill X" at the end of an otherwise easy fight, while also making it more clear when you're only trying to bring someone to an unconcious state.
Adenfal  (Apr 10) [60563] Making weapons with bayonets stab damage rather than bludgeoning would make more sense, if it's at all possible.
KAUS     (Apr 12) [ 2215] Have the snack bar in Evergreen actually sell snacks.
Mia      (Apr 12) [16232] Custom corpses displaying the style in which they were killed (Such as sliced in half, headless, beaten, etc)
KAUS     (Apr 15) [16295] Add a warning sign to the elevator of Mitsuhama so people know what levels they can and can't access without being shot to ribbons.
Mavrick  (Apr 28) [61503] when receiving items, being able to choose how many to receive, also if you can only carry a certain weight have the shopkeeper hang onto what you cannot carry. 
Maestra  (May  1) [39600] add "gps" to the gridguide helpfile alias
Mavrick  (May  2) [70601] help files on vehicular upgrades
Maika    (May 14) [32662] Make photos show what the graffiti is, instead of just saying a non-descript piece of graffiti is here.
Mavrick  (May 30) [ 3416] should be able to push wrecked vehicles in a direction, but should take time...(almost like the old concept "you start walking") depending on the weight/size of the vehicle
Frank    (Jun  4) [17110] Make the boxing ring at Figg's Gym !Mob so we don't have to interrupt RP to splatter a lone star.
Lu       (Jun 12) [ 9823] Make highway rooms off limits to mobs, so lowbie quest npcs stop trying to play in traffic.
Vladimir (Jun 13) [ 2235] implement the ability to broadcast/receive while remotely rigging, and broadcast while rigging please. very restricted by this :)
Daedalus (Jul  6) [ 2226] the spell increase reflexes appears to not work upon people who have tech modifying initiative through any means. in the case of the spell increase reaction this yields an error message relevant to the issue whereas with increase reflexes this yields the generic fail to bind message. both spells should give the tech error message which is "You's Reaction has been modified by technological means and is immune to this spell."
Onan     (Jul  8) [ 4675] a delete all mail from particular messager feature. presently i have 180 pieces of mail in my pocket secretary which i picked up today. also whenever i read any single message and exit reading that message the entire list is presented which is rather spammy
Alexi    (Jul 10) [60300] BLOCK <DIRECTION>  Allows a character to stand in the way of a door way or exit so as to prevent other players from passing by.  Requires the toggling of PK, cause if someone stands in your way.. your gonna need to fight em to get them out of the way.
Orien    (Jul 14) [14705] atm by the portland docwagon clinic so people can catch a cab to wherever they need to go
Daedalus (Aug  5) [ 2226] help surprise should detail that surprise attacks exist and use the stealth skill to determine who gets one or not
CNR      (Aug 13) [  600] transfer, be able to transfer orders you have waiting to someone else. EG: transfer 3 CNR
DirtyWork (Aug 17) [31118] Would be really nice if the info command told the proficiency for weapons.
Winter   (Aug 20) [11415] a glance command based off the stealth skill that allows you to look at someone without anybody noticing.
Daedalus (Sep  4) [ 2226] chargen room "Melee Combat Tutorial" should have a sign which states "machines are immune to purely mana-based spells such as manabolt and stunbolt, but not physical spells. Immune things fail to be affected by whatever they are immune to" this sign is needed because roughly once a week some newbie knocks himself out casting stunbolt on the robots in that room. since they always seem to use stunbolt perhaps the sign should simply say "robots cannot be stunned because they do not have brains"
Abiola   (Sep 26) [17120] Please put an area on the score sheet that automatically shows the amount of force points one is wearing in foci. :)
Cliff    (Sep 29) [19951] I think that some low end activesofts and knowsofts should be available in the newbie area, some twos and threes but nothing overly powerful, just so the people who drop the essence and money arn't shooting themselves i in the foot while they have some basicly useless cyberware starting out with.
Spindrift (Dec 10) [    0] Have corpses trigger an alert in mobs, especially guard type mobs. The average wageslave can flee, while tougher foes will be ready to shoot first and ask questions never. This way even if you can kill people without being seen or heard, you still need to thing about the mess you're making, and either  carry the bodies away or drag the mobs elsewhere for the kill. Pools of blood could also raise suspicion. Pools of blood and corpses should last a bit longer for this to have more of an impact.
Wolfgang (Jan  2) [35503] Put a few low end drone in character creation for riggers. Let them have something to use off the bat, even if it's low grade.
Shade    (Feb 13) [11407] Would be nice if there's was a "help whisper" file, or if it was referenced somewhere in sayto or say.
Onan     (Jul 17) [16222] an option to disable rule of six, something like 1/4 of manual dice rolls are initiative which doesnt use rule of six
Daedalus (Jul 20) [ 2226] help gridguide should also be called help gps
Daedalus (Jul 26) [ 2226] combine the chargen rooms "Entrance to the Awakened Worlds' Disclaimer Area" and ""Info" Help" and "Awake's Policy and Rules" having 3 rooms for this makes the mud preachy and authoritarian instead of the reality of having a few fairly simple rules. I am not neccessarily advocating for a reduction in total words on the topic. combining these rooms to at most two and putting the harsher sounding one after the have fun room would improve tone without reducing compliance. also the law enforcement room serves more to misinform than to inform. I suspect thats the single greatest cause of people thinking the cops are after them because they shot a wageslave and not because they are holding a gun. perhaps add the sentence "the single most common crime runners get caught committing is waving a gun around infront of lone star, followed closely by swords and other contraband."
Daedalus (Jul 30) [ 2205] some indication that messages received through the watch command arent messages from movement in the room of the watcher. perhaps a color code difference or a "from the room to the (direction)" addendum to the end of the message
Onan     (Aug 15) [32303] if logging on and a mail has been sent while you were away you should get a message indicating you have new mail just like back before pocket secretaries were put in
Onan     (Aug 17) [ 3464] fleeing when one's only target is mortally wounded or stunned should have a huge bonus. i just failed to flee a mortally wounded target
Nex      (Aug 20) [11407] have the pocket secretary beep audible when it's in any worn piece of gear (i.e. belt, pants, jacket, etc.). Note: the beep isn't audible if the pocsec is worn/held.
Onan     (Aug 31) [ 3521] mudmail should allow carbon copy sending particularly to onesself or immortals. so far ive gotten around this by copy pasting my message into two mudmail sendings.
Onan     (Sep  7) [11408] in reply to my latest bug report on mudmails A thin male in a snazzy suit says OOCly, "Onan: Best to ask if it can just list it by server time since that's what is posted on the message anyways" Onan approves of this suggestion
Amaya    (Nov 23) [32759] I think it would be pretty cool if we could see the number of successes on a sustained spell under STATUS.
Church   (Nov 24) [  605] make boxes of ammo unsellable in newbie area. or put a sign there that says selling them back without ammo in them for the purchase price is frowned upon.
Conway   (Nov 26) [ 2257] I recently picked up an Ares CC-10 Sniper Rifle and only realized it could not accept barrel mods when I couldn't put a rifle supressor on it. Maybe INFO could tell you what mod slots are open, in addition to what mods the weapon comes with?
Daedalus (Dec  4) [ 2226] help status second entry should be changed to state that "this command is used at the receptionist the lease was issued by"
Onan     (Dec  9) [22855] show command should include weapon accessories
Daedalus (Dec 29) [ 2226] there should be a command to see quickly how much force of foci one has implemented at once. perhaps this should be the focus command (which may be already used for living focus)
Daedalus (Jan  2) [ 2226] perhaps have something in the policy about complete automation and triggers and scripts being unacceptable [Rayfe] (OOC), "got the math and variables worked out so i can automate cracking credsticks completely ;)"
Daedalus (Mar 30) [26203] help skillwires refers to two helpfiles that are largely redundant with each other. combine these into one entry
Daedalus (Apr  2) [ 2226] help drain  everytime you cast a spell you suffer drain. drain is basically an attack on you by magic. the power of that attack is half force plus a modifier specific to that spell. the damage level is the damage of the spell plus a modifier specific to that spell. resistance is done with willpower and spell pool allocated to drain
Reese    (May  2) [ 2016] Can we get some info text for vehicles?  Or a helpfile that has the names and stats formated like the vendor lists would be good.  Not having the books is a hindrance in choosing.
Neadeh   (Jun  9) [33005] I have an antique pocketwatch that only works when i wear it like a belt.  I would much rather have it work from my six button vest or my coat like my pen radio does.
Daedalus (Jul  1) [ 2226] repeated because of typo. help ic should also have an entry duplicating the in character channels portion of help channels
Daedalus (Jul  8) [ 2226] help metamagic should say to "to use a metamagic technique one must select that technique during an initiation and train that technique from a trainer"
Onan     (Jul 23) [11407] longweapon should kick in after draw and wield commands echo. presently messages like the following get confusing "Keth, wielding an H&K USP45 draws an H&K USP45 from a close fitting synthleather shoulder holster."
Daedalus (Jul 31) [ 2226] help examine should say something at the bottom like ^rDo note the results of this command are your character's expert opinion, your character may be a dumbass^N
Daedalus (Jul 31) [ 2226] help police procedures should end with "Like all skills the results of these skill tests are your character's expert opinion or expert activity, your character may be wrong or fail."
Daedalus (Jul 31) [ 2226] help law should have a see also police procedures
Daedalus (Aug  3) [ 2226] help gridguide should be also called help gps. a frequent question is what is gps for
Onan     (Aug 22) [32303] jim's fixit should response to receive all. a couple times i have gone to repair several items and missed receiving one, also would just make it easier than receiving individually
Daedalus (Sep  1) [ 2226] presently when i type " help map" I see a map of grenada I should instead see help map index
Daedalus (Sep 17) [ 2226] help design should be divided into three paragraphs. presently program design is one, and cyberdeck component and spell design are a second paragraph. spell design should be a third paragraph
Daedalus (Sep 18) [ 2226] help skillwires should say in bold "Using a skillsoft temporarily overrides your current skill level to that of the skillsofts rating"
Daedalus (Sep 25) [ 2226] help grade should be in two parts, first part should explain cyberware grades, second part should say grade is also a measure of the number of initiations a person has had.
Daedalus (Sep 29) [ 2226] help emote should reference help position
Ex       (Oct 14) [ 1812] a chance to do favors for vendors to get reduced tn's for ordering items, maybe have it work that if you buy from them a lot, you can have a chance to have the vendor ask you if you want to do him a favor, kind of like a run, go out, do the thing, come back and let vendor know it's finished, and they will say something like "ok good, since you did that I'll try a bit harder to get some stuff in for you" (though not as faggy sounding), and it raises your chances of ordering things from said vendor.
Lovets   (Nov 22) [60573] making the lockers at the train station just a wee bit larger. These things are meant for holding bags and such, and I couldn't fit an encoder in one...3kg and the size of a shoebox...
Durant   (Jan 30) [    0] add a child lock upgrade you can install in vehicles that can be activated, which only prevents people who do not own the vehicle from leaving
Scamandros (Mar 10) [45190] put all the typical slang, IE 'drek', 'frag' 'chum', et cetera, into a helpfile 'help slang'
Durant   (Mar 11) [12582] Make squatters, bag ladies, and other homeless people attempt to loot corpses-particularly when there is nobody in the room.
Durant   (Mar 13) [14627] Add a Hardpoint 'Bug Zapper' Automated Turret for vehicles that automatically fires the installed weaponry at people who attack it.
Durant   (Mar 13) [62167] Add a stop drop and roll command useable only outside of combat to put out fires. Or use fire extinguisher.
Durant   (Mar 18) [ 7283] add the response "Are you SURE?" when someone types in "kill everything"
Durant   (Mar 19) [    0] Allow non-magical characters to raise their attributes up to attribute maximums (Ref: pg244, SR3rd) with similar TKE requirements that initiations cost.
Durant   (Mar 24) [31703] add the ability to enable/disable allowing other people to see you speak into a radio [apologies if this is a repeat]
Keth     (Jul  1) [ 8680] A command to turn off the concealment value of overcoats. A lot of the nicer armor clothing about body pieces make it impossible to show off the rest of your outfit, and.. I'm vain.
Spindrift (Jul 12) [35616] Have Johnsons randomly call you for jobs, based on reputation. It would be a run you would get anyway, but Johnsons having your number would need certain reputation or they won't have your number or have heard of you.
Scamandros (Jul 31) [ 2429] It'd be neat to allow adepts with Killing Hands to switch between blunt and bladed damage messages.
Durant   (Aug 28) [11407] allow the survey command to also inform you how well-lit a room is
Nonzensy (Oct 23) [62101] mark rooms which are environmental hazardous, like water with "^B(water)" in their directional description. people should be able to see that they are going somewhere dangerous.
Nonzensy (Oct 23) [62101] make a peer <direction> or peek <direction> command to get a look into a rooms description without entering it.
Dewitt   (Oct 25) [ 9824] You should either add some respawning bmx bikes to seattle or have cabbies give you a single free ride after you get killed and are nude+have no money in account or on person. Currently, if you're out in tarislar or something and weren't aware that docwagon deducts from your account rather than your person on death, then the mud goes 'Wahaha you can't get on the highway, got no money, nobody's hiring for a simple courier job. Get fucked player!'
Dewitt   (Oct 25) [29036] Ok I just realized that the seattle monorail actually runs to auburn. 
Tensor   (Oct 27) [14341] maybe make the "John Smith" gopher run of finding the "folder and a datachip marked 'Underground passage'" a little easier to find.. I've combed the entire ork underground and its shops and inns and stores, combed the entire dark tunnels, found and fully combed both the council island entrance and the redmond barrens entrance to the ork underground and all the passages between, and I've even found the drug traffiking ring itself and combed as much of that area as I could, opening and looting all objects.. NOT A SINGLE FOLDER OR DATACHIP but I did find a nice gyroget pistol. If the run is to kill one of those drug traffikers to get a chip from them then you shoud mention that in the run. If not and its just sitting somewhere, then you sure chose the ass-end of noewhere to stuff it deep into.
Hazmat   (Oct 28) [ 8302] Ability to mount a robot grasper and a small cargo space on a rotodrone, and let it pick up items and give them to people. Also, if you're remoted into a vehicle with autonav and tell it to gridguide to somewhere, it'll go to do so and kick you out, but then detect no passengers and go 'herp derp' and just sit there disabling autonav, so it'd be pretty cool if autonav still worked with no passengers
Tensor   (Oct 29) [ 6451] It'd be pretty awesome if you could subscribe to your vehicles even if you didn't have a control rig or a remote control, but with heavy limitations. Like, have a mini cheapo encrypted remote control deck that is just a device and doesn't require a datajack or a rig, and the only thing you can do with it is send and recieve gridguide commands to that vehicle. So you could subscribe it to your ford americar or whatever and set it up with coordinates, then tell it to go there. Useless if the area isn't connected to your grid network but still handy.
Epiphany (Nov  3) [17126] Should be able to loot dead hardcore players.
Durant   (Nov  7) [    0] have adept trainers remove abilities from the list once they are maxed out for that particular trainer
Gaston   (Nov  8) [30557] It'd be neat if you could take a wreck that wasn't yours and repair it to workingness, then use a command and go through the process of claiming it, you could go through a period of rl days in which the original owner would be notified to either pick it up or forfiet it (or if the owner is deleted or hardcore dead, would just go through). If this passes without the original owner picking it up or canceling the claim remotely, then it'd rekey to the person that claimed it. You could use the same mechanic with less delay to transfer cars to other people in person, so you could player-sell vehicles and drones and stuff. Salvage and trade 
Gaston   (Nov  9) [35600] it'd be pretty handy if there were a command to unload vehicles from the outside, that only worked when the vehicle was unlocked. Like, 'cargo list' would give a listing of things in the rear of the vehicle if it was unlocked, 'cargo load <thing>' would stuff <thing> into the back, and 'cargo unload <thing>' would take <thing> out of the back OR in the case of a drone or a vehicle, push it out onto the street.
Gaston   (Nov 10) [32002] You know, with all the various runs that require you to kick open 6 or 7+ strength "doors" to progress, would it really be unreasonable to have a door buster that you could wield to give a bonus on checks vs doors, or like, ability to use shotguns on them and actually do damage, or like, a crowbar. Or just attrition. Cutters. SOMETHING. Basically you've got an arbitrary obstacle that only cybered up people, somatics with a very specific ability that has a high point cost and can not be used for anything besides doors in this mud, or metahumans with racial bonuses to strength can get past.
Rifkin   (Nov 27) [  610] rentable lockers that are affordable (like 1000 per irl month) that are in places like the tacoma metro station and the airport and stuff where people can store excess gear without having to pay stupid amounts of money for an apartment
Rifkin   (Dec  3) [  600] have the price of the items listed when you use the check command
Rifkin   (Dec 20) [ 3521] create a stock market so i can gamble money away without having to do much effort
Rifkin   (Dec 20) [ 3521] creating just some form of gambling would suffice
Mabus    (Mar 29) [32665] make some quests repeatable with a timer that resets weekly so there's always something to do 
Geneon   (Jun  2) [ 4930] in combat, when an enemy misses you, it should be yellow instead of red, to show a miss.
Edge     (Jul  3) [35587] Toggle for Hunger/Thirst messages.
Zink     (Jul 24) [    0] when sleeping, not have screen scroll of 'events', such as... "An orkish woman drives through here on her Harley Scorpion."
Tark     (Aug 24) [  607] to encourage more IC communication, pop a terminal in all known bar locations with the bartender
Tark     (Aug 24) [  605] add everett to the listed places on the cab sign. Works, but not currently listed.
Payne    (Aug 25) [17116] When at a shop that is closed, maybe when  they say they are closed, they could also say when they will open. 
Zink     (Aug 25) [ 2007] list the room names of the ferries as the two places they service, so there is less confusion as to which goes where from a glance.
Epiphany (Aug 27) [30500] Create RPObject. A command that lets you create a non-valuable object to use for RP, much like players use create deck for the same function. Except Create RPObject should also allow the editing of the in room description. Maybe with a tag at the bottom of the look desc that says "This object is NERP" to prevent abuse.
Geiger   (Jan 21) [    0] suppose I could jsut stack up on armor and take the penalties
Dasyr    (Mar  3) [    0] Add a note about slouch penalties to customize and slouch help files, clarifying what they are
Scrapper (May 26) [    0] Add a note to help detection that indicates Detection Factor is (Masking + Sleaze) / 2 rounded _Down_.  The tabletop rule is round up, so this may throw off deck-builders.
Fjaln    (Jun  1) [    0] modes for melee weapons that can possibly do stun or physical damage. e.g. stunlance, chainsaw, some swords and axes. Oh, and the ultimate: board with a nail in it.
Rhode    (Jun  5) [ 4941] partial karma for rendering a mob unconscious
Durant   (Oct 29) [62174] change large kraken tentacle description from "unfinished object" to "A slimy oversized sushi ingredient"
Stryker  (Sep 16) [12466] Make it so when characters are deleted, through inactivity or whatever, that any vehicles owned by them are purged from the game world as well. This would likely clear up a lot of the vehicles cluttering the parking lots.
Stryker  (Sep 16) [12466] Allow gas vents to be removed/replaced. Either linked to the weapon Build and Repair skill, or even without. Would allow for much more customization of weapons.
Mass     (Oct 11) [  601] tube
Mass     (Oct 11) [  601] 1
Mass     (Oct 11) [17126] 666
Reaper   (Oct 22) [38074] It has been brought to my attention that at 10000 REP you are no longer able to do autoruns. I was wondering if you could tag another 0 on that so the end of autoruns comes at 100k instead of 10k - that would allow for almost unlimited advancement since nobody would ever reach that way. However, in the current state I feel like if I keep playing I'll hit 10k in the not so distant future. I'm already almost halfway there. So please raise the cap for when autoruns are no longer available from 10k to 100k please!
Stryker  (Oct 22) [    0] My suggestion is for some type of keyring item. You'd be able to put keys/keycards/etc. into this keyring and then the keyring itself would act as whatever keys are inside of it, without having to search through and remove each key to lock/unlock doors. I feel it would make for a nice quality-of-life addition.
Reaper   (Oct 26) [62198] It would be cool if we could purchase pets, both mundane and paracritters, that will follow you, obey certain orders and fight for or with you. Awake is based off of CircleMUD and I think this functionality for shops to purchase "mobs" comes with vanilla CircleMUD but if not I know there are CircleMUD snippets for it. Would be cool to run around with a pet hell hound in tow.
Reaper   (Nov  2) [ 3521] In the ability list, for abilities that are either on or off and don't show a number next to it when activating it then checking abilities, could you add a (On) flag in abilities so we know what toggled abilities (Like Blind Fighting) are activated?
Ethor    (Feb 28) [60567] Tell stealth-fone hi
Onna     (Mar 22) [38064] be able to examine items in the shop before you buy them, can add on to the info command.
Gouki    (Apr  2) [30607] make the banks sell credsticks of varying degrees.
Gouki    (Apr  3) [19964] Just unimplement skill quests until they're all complete and raise the normal practiceable skill cap back to 12
Joshua   (Apr 28) [32674] remove fire/acid spells from mobs
Armitage (Jun  7) [  600] Raise run payouts
Joshua   (Jun 13) [ 2961] prime runner chargen with more build points etc
Jenny    (Nov 10) [  606] earring
Chariot  (Nov 12) [29009] It'd be awesome if there's a way to toggle so that npcs or objects with the same name show up in bulk rather than in separate lines. It clutters my client output very fast, especially those vehicles.
Armitage (Jul 31) [ 7230] make the Chinatown stores buy everything and be open for 24hrs so I can clean out my garage.
Lucien   (Apr  7) [10000] Add HELP SPERETHIEL to explain what the language actually is.
Testmort (May 22) [10014] Given area built as A-B-C, if shooting from A at someone in C, have a chance of hitting randos in B when you miss.
Lucien   (May 22) [10001] let the STOP command stop you from fighting
Lucien   (May 26) [70302] limit pgroup command columns to 4 for better phone usability
Lucien   (May 26) [70316] TOGGLE colums to 2 for phones
Lucien   (May 26) [60502] Add feedback for zswitch command
Lucien   (May 28) [60504] HELP TRAINING does not exist, make this a keyword for HELP TRAIN
Lucien   (May 28) [60504] Have the QUEST command (nonexist) give feedback that they should be asking the NPC for a job verbally.
Lucien   (May 28) [60504] Allow qedit to set a -1 reward
Lucien   (May 28) [60504] Specify maximum allowable rep value in qedit
Lucien   (May 28) [60504] Add a message to SKILLS for empty skill list ("You haven't learned any skills yet." or something)
Lucien   (May 29) [60505] add HELP UNPRACTICE and HELP UNTRAIN; link them to their unflavored counterparts
Lucien   (May 30) [60559] AFFECT -> STATUS mapping
Paragorn (Jun 12) [70512] wt history should just show history
Paragorn (Jun 12) [70513] Give Hollow Scythe (70502) some things to mutter, like 'I used to think I could control ducks with my mind, but it turns out ducks and I just have very similar ideas about what stuff ducks should do'
Paragorn (Jun 12) [70511] Add a spec proc at 70511 (inside bus) that prevents you from going west without meeting some precondition
Paragorn (Jun 12) [70511] Add trap spec-procs and ability to detect and disarm traps.
Lucien   (Jul  6) [60507] Update HELP POLE ARMS to indicate that it's used when using a bayonet. Update HELP CLUBS to indicate that it's used when defending against melee attacks with a gun. Add HELP BAYONET to explain that it turns a gun into a pole arm for melee purposes when attached.
Lucien   (Jul  6) [60627] Add info to HELP AMMO about gunsmithing / making more ammo.
Lucien   (Jul  6) [60627] prevent restringing of weapon attachments and vehicle upgrades
Lucien   (Nov 30) [10000] instead of punishing people with KILLER flag for hitting player vehicle, just don't let them hit itLucien   (Dec  8) [60500] SS weapons fire EXACTLY ONCE PER COMBAT PHASE.
