"ASSAULT RIFLES"

Linked Attribute: ^gQuickness^n

The assault rifle skill allows you to use the more powerful assault rifles.
Their use is different than that of a standard ^Wrifle^n, and hence fall under
a different category.  All rifles however may mount a barrel, an under-barrel
and a top mounting accessory.
