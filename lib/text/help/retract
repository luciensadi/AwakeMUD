RETRACT

Usage: ^gRETRACT <Cyberware>^n

This command is used to extend and retract any retractable cyberware you
have. While they are retracted they are not visible except to people who
assense you and any combat will use your fists and deal stun damage. Once 
they are extended you will use them in any hand to hand combat, using the 
Cyber Implants skill.
