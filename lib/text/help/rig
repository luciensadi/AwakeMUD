RIG

When inside a vehicle, with the proper cyberware, the rig command
connects you with the vehicle, making you one with the vehicle in
your mind.  It becomes a full simsense (simulated senses) experience,
where you feel the hydraulic fluid and gasoline become your bloodstream
and the engine become your heart as you feel the road beneath you.

It can be used in conjunction with a remote control deck and a vehicle
to control a vehicle or drone remotely.
