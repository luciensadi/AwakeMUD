POSITION EVADE PARRY

Test: See Notes
Utility: Cloak
Usage: ^g<EVADE/PARRY/POSITION>^n

These 3 operations form a type of action known as a combat maneuver.
They are used to give the icon performing them an edge in combat.
^rEvade^n detection is used to hide from the icon you are engaging in
cybercombat, ^rParry^n attack is used to bolster your defense and ^rPosition^n
attack makes it easier for you to hit your target. If performed against
an IC you are pitting your Evasion rating against the host security rating
and if against another decker you are pitting your Evasion against their 
Sensors rating. The cloak program makes it easier for you to perform
combat maneuvers where as the Lock-On utility makes it easier for you to 
prevent your opponents using them against you.
