CYBERWARE

Usage: ^gCYBERWARE^n

Cyberware is the name for electronics which are merged with a living body.
Its origins began with the need for improved prosthetics, but in the modern
day, cyberware has become much more.  With cyberware, your body's natural
limitations can be overcome.  Everything from increased strength and
speed, to retractable razors (a favorite of the ^Wstreet samurai^n) is
possible.  There are limitations however.  First, all cyberware has two
costs--a monetary value, and an ^Wessence^n cost.  Because cyberware actually
replaces living tissues a person using it will lose part of their 'life
force', or ^Wessence^n.  Therefore, the maximum amount of cyberware one can
used is directly related to what the ^Wessence^n cost of the cyberware is
and your ^Wessence^n.
