ATTRIBUTES

You have 9 attributes, six which you can raise through the use of karma.
These attributes are:  Body, Quickness, Strength, Charisma, Intelligence,
Willpower, Magic, Reaction, and Essence.

Your Magic attribute starts off at 6 only if you follow the Hermetic,
Shamanic, or Adept traditions, otherwise it is 0.  The magic attribute can
only be raised through becoming an Initiate and/or joining a magical group.
Mundanes (non-spell casters) can never raise their magic attribute.

Essence can never be raised, but is only lowered through death and the use
of invasive procedures, such as ^Wcyberware^n.  You can have an essence of 0, but
you will probably be close to insane.  If it drops below 0, you die
permanently.

Your attributes can be raised through a trainer.  If you have just created
a character, you will have points to distribute to your attributes on a
one for one basis.  In other words, if you have 6 points to distribute, and
have a strength of 3, you could increase the strength to 6 by spending only
3 points.  You must use up all these points at the trainer in the Neophytic
Guild, because the other trainers around the world will not train you until
you have used them up.

Once you have used up your initial points to distribute, you can raise your
attributes by spending karma.  It costs the new level of the attribute times
2 in karma to raise it one point, ie if your willpower is 4, it will cost you 
10 karma to raise it to 5.

you are looking for.
