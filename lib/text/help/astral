"ASTRAL PLANE"

The Astral Plane is a parallel dimension to the corporeal plane.  They both
share the same world -- that is, time is consistent, and all inanimate
objects in the corporeal plane have astral counterparts (but one must
remember that these astral counterparts do not abide by the laws of corporeal
physics).  The Astral Plane is the source of magical energy, as well as the
space through which it travels.

Magical beings in the physical dimension have active forms in the astral
plane, while other beings have dormant forms: forms that can be seen from
the Astral Plane, but not affected.  All things that have even the slightest
magical energy can be seen, assensed, and affected by astral beings.
