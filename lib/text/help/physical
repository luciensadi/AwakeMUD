PHYSICAL "PHYSICAL POINTS"

Physical points are a measure of what physical condition you are in
relative to your attributes.  This number ranges from -(BODY) to 10, with
anything below 0 meaning you are on the verge of death.  The most you can
fall below zero is equal to your body attribute.  Beyond this means 
instant death.  This number, like your ^Wmental points^n, never raises beyond
10.  The reason is that this number is affected by your attributes, so,
for example, my physical condition of 10 may mean alot more than your
condition of 10.  (This is why ^Wattributes^n and ^Wskills^n are so important as
you ratings in those directly affect what your physical points really
mean).

To recover physical points, you must either get magical healing, visit a
hospital, or rest (or ^Wsleep^n).  These are in order of most effective to
least effective.

Any weapon which is not blunt will strike for physical damage, with the
end goal being death of your opponent.  If you don't wish to kill your
oppenent, use a blunt weapon (including your hands).
