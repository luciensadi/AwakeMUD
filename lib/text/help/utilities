UTILITIES

Utilities are the programs the Decker uses to strut their stuff around
the Matrix. Without passcodes or programs to get them through Security,
a Decker would have to sit and twiddle their thumbs in hope of getting
in by chance. No Decker should be without Utilities, and no Decker can
do anything without them. You can find help on all of the commands listed
in the affects column.
