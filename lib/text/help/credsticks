CREDSTICKS

Credsticks are the most common form of currency in 2064.  They are commonly
shaped like a pen, and all have a small display which shows the current
balance of the credstick.  Credsticks can basically be considered electronic
money -- universally accessible and accepted, they take away all the hassle
of paper money, and have built-in security measures, in addition.

Standard credsticks (typically constructed from plastic or steel) use a
6-digit passcode for security.  Silver credsticks (made either from silver
or, less often, titanium) have a thumbprint screen.  Platinum credsticks, the
highest quality and most expensive, sometimes made from emerald, have a
built-in retinal scanner.  All levels of credsticks allow only the owner to
access the account.

Unlike paper money, however, credsticks leave a trail.  Because of this,
paper money is always used for the less legal activities.
