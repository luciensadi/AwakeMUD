MENTAL "MENTAL POINTS"

Your mental points (abbreviated M on your prompt) are a display of your
current mental condition.  This number ranges from 0 to 10.  If it
falls to 0 (or below), you will immediately fall unconscious.  Any
damage taken in addition to falling unconscious will begin to
subtract from your ^Wphysical points^n, until you are dead.  Your mental
condition is particularly important to spell users, as casting spells
will sometimes drain your mental points.  If you fall unconscious,
any sustained spells will be dropped immediately.  Just like physical
points, mental points always remain at a maximum of 10.

To recover mental points, you must spend some time resting, if not
sleeping.  Sleeping obviously recovers mental points quicker.

^RNote:  Any damage done to you, or which you deal in which you are using
       a blunt weapon, will do mental damage only.  Once they are knocked
       unconscious, you can begin to do physical damage to them.  The
       reason is that you don't always need to kill everyone, and somtimes,
       just knocking an oppenent unconscious is a better solution.  Once
       they fall unconscious, you will stop hitting them.  If you wish to
       continue damaging them, you must keep attacking (this keeps you from
       accidentally killing someone you were trying to subdue).^n
