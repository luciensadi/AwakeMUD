DOCWAGON MODULATOR

DocWagons can, quite literally, save your life.  When you are in critical
condition, an activated DocWagon modulator will report your condition and
position to the nearest unit, which, depending on the security surrounding
your location, may or may not come to your rescue and take you to a hospital.
Because of the care taken to ensure your health once you arrive, a strong
sedative is applied and doctors perform numerous tests, leaving you
unconscious and, once you awaken, very fatigued.  All of this, of course,
does not come free.  If you do not have enough to pay the fee (which is
inversely proportional to the level of your DocWagon contract), then your
contract is revoked.

There are three levels of DocWagon service.  The higher the level, the more
likely it is that you will be rescued when critical.  Bronze is the most
basic, and therefore the cheapest service.  Gold is the medium level, and
platinum the highest.
