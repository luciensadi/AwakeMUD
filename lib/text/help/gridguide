Gridguide is the autonav system that is built in to most vehicles. No
driving skill is needed to use a gridguide system but the destination
must be known before hand. Once started using GRIDGUIDE <location> you
will automatically move on the quickest paved route to the location,
provided there is a full run of gridguide enabled streets.
Gridguide on its own will display a list of available gridguide coordinaties
for you to choose from. Adding a location can be performed in two different
manners depending on wether or not you already know the gridguide coordinates.
GRIDGUIDE ADD <location> adds the location you are currently at to the gridguide
list under whatever name you put in the location argument. The numbers following
the name in the GRIDGUIDE list are the coordinates, and can be entered in any
gridguide system to copy it.
If you are using gridguide and wish to stop GRIDGUIDE STOP will bring the car
to a complete halt.

If you have a portable GPS scanner or GridGuide device, typing GRIDGUIDE while
outside of a vehicle will report the current GPS Coordinates.
