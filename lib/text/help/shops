SHOPS STORES

Shops come in many guises in the 6th world, from your corner store to an electronics
supermarket, and down to even the most nefarious fixer. Some of these accept only
cash, some only credstick, while others accept both. As a general rule of thumb
the more reputable the dealer the less likely he is to take cash.
  Some shops may not have the item you're looking for currently in stock, displayed
next to the name will be the average time it will take for him to order it in if you
try and buy it.
