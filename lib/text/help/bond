BOND

Usage: ^GBOND <modulator>
       BOND <focus> <spell/category/spirit>
       BOND <focus>^n


Bond has two purposes: to personalize DocWagon modulators or to bond magical
foci.  Anyone can use this to accomplish the former, but only awakened
individuals can bond foci. Shamans and Mages can bond any type of foci, but
adepts can only bond weapon foci. There is a karma cost associated with
bonding foci that is dependant on the type of foci and force. Once bonded
you cannot unbond a focus, but someone else can rebond it and sever your
link with it, rendering it useless to you.
If you stop bonding a focus halfway through you can restart it again later
by bonding the focus without specifying the category. It will start the bonding
process again but won't cost you any karma.

Example:
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus combat sense^n
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus earth elemental^n
^c< 10P 10M > bond focus combat^n
