THROW

Usage: ^gTHROW <direction>^n

This allows you to throw weapons at people, or mobs. Most often used with
projectile weapons such as grenades, shuriken and throwing knives, this
can often be a very good way of wearing someone out. You need to be wielding
the object you will throw, however, before you throw it. This will only
ever throw the weapon one room.
