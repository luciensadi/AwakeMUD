JOHNSONS JOHNSON

Johnsons are simply nicknames for those high ranking members of society that
come to you with jobs they need done by someone anonymous. Johnsons, slimy
and evil as they are, are some of your best clients. You need them for
^Wshadowruns^n, and your whole way of life. Not only that, but they also
posess far greater power than you. As the saying goes, "if you can't beat
'em, join 'em."
