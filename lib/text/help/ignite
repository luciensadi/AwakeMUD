IGNITE

Category: Manipulation
Type: Physical

Ignite causes the atoms in the targets body to begin to vibrate at a high
speed causing the target to heat up to the point that they spontaneously
combust. While surrounded by flames the target is pretty much incapacitated
and faces damage every combat turn.
