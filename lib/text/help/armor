ARMOR ARMOUR BALLISTIC IMPACT

Your armor class has two different ratings, ballistic and impact.  With
ballistic armor you resist damage from high speed and impact weapons such as
bullets.  Impact armor on the other hand resists low speed attacks resulting
usually from melee, grenades, arrows, and similar attacks.  Ballistic armor
offers no help against impact attacks and vice-versa.  Examples of armor
classes follow:

Impact:                          Ballistic:
-------                          ----------
0  -  Basic clothing             0 - Basic clothing
1  -  Synthetic leather          1 - Armor helmet
2  -  Real leather               2 - Armor vest
3  -  Plated clothing            3 - Armor Clothing

Most armor will offer both types of protection, though some will offer only
one type.  

When wearing more than one piece of armour a process known as layering takes
places. The rating of the highest rated piece of armour will be applied in
full, then half the value of all the other pieces are applied. The total of
all armour at its full rating is used to calculate penalties though.

If the unlayered total of all your ballistic or impact armour exceeds your
quickness you will begin to experience penalties due to your movement
being restricted. You will move slower, lose combat pool and have a hard
time using quickness linked skills such as stealth or ranged combat.
Form fitting armour is not included in the total used to calculate penalties.
