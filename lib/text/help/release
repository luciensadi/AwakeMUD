RELEASE

Usage: ^gRELEASE <elemental/spirit> <number>^n
       ^gRELEASE <spell number>^n
       ^GRELEASE ALL^n

This command is used by mages and shamans to release conjured
spirits or elementals from their control. They can specify wether
to release an elemental or spirit and then the number of the spirit,
which can be garnered from looking at the spirit or elemental command.
Using this command forfeits all remaining services the spirit or
elemental owes you, and it will vanish from the physical and astral
planes for good.
This command is also used to stop sustaining a spell, freeing up
your concentration for other tasks, or sustaining more spells.
