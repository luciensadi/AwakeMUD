"RANGED COMBAT"

Syntax: ^gSHOOT <target> <direction>^n

Ranged combat is the system of survival in the Sprawl. If you don't have a gun,
don't expect to last long chummer. You can always see people further than the
room you're standing in, so you can use ^Wscan^n to check the adjacent
rooms for possible targets. No one can scan more than one room away without
the aid of magnifying devices. The range of the gun also plays a large
role. You won't be able to shoot someone, if he's out of your gun's range.

The direction is which direction the mob is from you. So if you scan and see
a mob north of you that you want to shoot, you'd type in:

^c< 10P 10M > shoot mob north^n

This would shoot the mob once, and then combat is commenced. Many mobs have
different reactions to being shot from a distance. You will come across these
reactions as you use the system more and more.
