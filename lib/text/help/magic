MAGIC "MAGIC ATTRIBUTE"

Your magic attribute is a rating of how much magical energy you can control.
If you are a mundane, you are a mundane for life, ie, you'll never be able to
raise your magic rating above 0.  Your magic rating determines how powerful
a spell you can ^Wcast^n, so with a magic rating of 6 you can safely cast force
6 spells and take only mental drain.  If you cast a spell above your magic
rating, you will take physical damage as the power overloads your mind
and bursts cells and blood vessels.  Your magic rating also increases your
ability to perform in astral space.  You can raise your magic rating by
becoming an initiate or joining a magical group.
