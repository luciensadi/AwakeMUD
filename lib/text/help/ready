READY DRAW

Usage: ^gREADY <holster/sheath>
       DRAW^n

The ready command is used to ready a holster/sheath for drawing. A
readied holster/sheath will be drawn from automatically when you
enter combat. The ^WDraw^n command can be used to draw a weapon from
a readied holster/sheath outside of combat.

Heavy weapons cannot be quick drawed and readying them has no effect.
