ALIAS ALIASES

An ^Ralias^n is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ^RALIAS^n command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
^RALIAS^n alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

^c< 10P 10> alias^n

Type ^cALIAS <alias name> <command>^n to create a new ^Ralias^n.  The ^Ralias^n name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overriden by an alias (other than the
^RALIAS^n command itself, of course).

^c< 10P 10M > alias gbb get bread bag
< 10P 10M > alias gac get all corpse^n

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

^c< 10P 10M > alias gbb^n

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

^c< 10P 10M > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread^n

Note that the ^Reat^n contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal ^Reat^n command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

^c< 10P 10M > alias killem cast "fireball" $1; cast 4 "powerblast" $2
< 10P 10M > killem tzeentch rat^n

Would cast fireball on Tzeentch, followed by casting a force 4 powerblast on a sewer rat.
Variables may be used repeatedly and in any order:

^c< 10P 10M > alias helpem cast "heal" moderate $1; cast "heal" serious $1; cast "combat sense" $1^n

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

^c< 10P 10M > alias tc tell che $*
< 10P 10M > tc hi there, how are you today?^n
^rYou tell Che, 'hi there, how are you today?'^n
