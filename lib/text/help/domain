DOMAIN

Usage: ^gDOMAIN <domain>^n

This command is used by shamans to switch the domain they are in.
This is useful for changing the type of spirit which can be summoned
and which spirits can be controlled. If you are currently controlling
a spirit of a certain domain and move out of it you forfeit all remaining
services that spirit owes you. This command can only be used to switch
domains in areas that are part of multiple domains, otherwise it just
displays the current domain.
