"BOOSTED ATTRIBUTES"

Usage: ^gBOOST <QUICKNESS/STRENGTH/BODY>^n

This is a limited version of the Improved Attribute power. Although
much cheaper it only lasts for a limited time which depends on the
attribute being boosted and the user's magic rating. Once the boost
wears off the user risks facing drain depending how high their
attribute is boosted.

The power must first be activated before you can boost with it.
