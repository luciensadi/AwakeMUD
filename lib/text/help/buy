BUY

Usage: ^gBUY [Cash/Cred] [AMOUNT] <ITEM>^n

If you'd like to purchase an item from a ^Wshop^n and have the money, you can
buy it. Items can be bought by name, or by their number in the shop listing,
and can be bought in quantity. Purchasing an item looks for a personalized
credstick by default. If you do not have a credstick, you can also pay for
something with cash if the store accepts it.
If the item is not currently in stock, the shop keeper will tell you when
you can come back to pick it up
  

Examples:

^c< 10P 10M > buy gun          (buy the first gun on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy #3           (buy the third item on the list)
< 10P 10M > buy 4.gun        (buy the fourth gun on the list)
