STRENGTH

Your strength rating represents how much you can lift, carry, and how
hard you can hit someone.  With 6 being the maximum for a ^Whuman^n (such
as Hans and Franz), a ^Wtroll^n with a strength of 10 quite easily out-arm
wrestles such heroes.  Strength can be important in melee combat, where
a weapons damage is directly related to your strength.  It does not however
affect your skill in using a melee weapon, unless you don't have either an
^Warmed^n or ^Wunarmed combat^n skill (in which case, your skill is slightly
based on your strength). Strength is also used along with Body for deciding
if you can wield a heavy weapon without a gyroharness. The minimum Body and
Strength ratings to perform such an action are 8.
