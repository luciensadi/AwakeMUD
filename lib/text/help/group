GROUP

Usage: ^gGROUP [player]
       GROUP all^n

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share karma for killing monsters
equally among the group. ^WKarma^n will only be shared among group members
that are in the same location, at the time of the killing blow. Sharing is
regardless of wherther the group members have been participating in the fight.

GROUP with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
GROUP ALL groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the ^Wfollow^n command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

^cFinnegan and Sedic wishes to group with Wisp.

Finnegan : "follow wisp"
Sedic: "follow wisp"
(Wisp should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group wisp"
Dragon  : "group Sedic"
Dragon  : "group Finnegan"^n

Later when Wisp get upset at Finnegan (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types: "Group Finnegan" to kick Finnegan out of the group.

Make sure when you are grouped that you note the names and descriptions of
your fellow group members. This is to avoid confusion when shooting at
NPCs with similar names.
