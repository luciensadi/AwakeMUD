TOTEMS

When a shaman chooses a totem, (s)he is choosing which part of nature to
emulate. The shaman's connectivity to the natural world depends on the
totem and the animal it represents. Since the totem is the source of the
shaman's power, it affects all aspects of the shaman's life. The extent to
which this influence is manifested is described in the specific totem 
listings.
