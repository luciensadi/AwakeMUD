DECKERS

Deckers are people who have chosen the path of computers and the ^WMatrix^n.
By 2064, the entire world depends on the ^WMatrix^n for passing and manipulating
information.  Though often time awkward in 'real life', in the ^WMatrix^n, they
can be more dangerous than a Street Sam in the city.  From slipping between
the cracks, to crashing major networks, deckers find happiness in their
control over that virtual reality.

No matter how good a decker is, they will always need ^WPrograms^n to keep
them alive. Not only this, they also use ^WUtilities^n to help make their
way around the Matrix.
