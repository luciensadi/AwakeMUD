MAGES "HERMETIC MAGES"

Given many names, mages are people who were born with magical ability and
have chosen to follow the hermetic tradition.  Mages are the group of people
who believe ^Wmagic^n is like a science that can be studied.  They build
libraries to further their studies, conjure elementals, and manipulate the
magical energies through knowledge.  Though they may partly understand how
^Wshamans^n perform ^Wmagic^n, they conceptualize it differently.  Mages see
their art through the lenses of complex formulae, symbols, theories, and
practice.
