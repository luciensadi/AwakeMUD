MPCP

The Master Persona Control Program, or MPCP runs on a grouping of optical
chips that are the heart of the deck. It contains the master operating
system that integrates the deck's ^WPrograms^n. It lets the decker control
their appearance in the Matrix and translates Grid signals into sensory
input that the Decker can see, feel, and hear. If the MPCP crashes, the
Decker is automatically dumped.

The Persona's attributes are a combination of the MPCP and four ^WPrograms^n
that all decks must run. No program greater than the MPCP rating may be run
on a deck.
