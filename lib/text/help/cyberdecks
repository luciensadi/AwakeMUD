CYBERDECKS

^WCyberdecks^n are stunningly complex devices, even by the standards of 2064.
Not only do they contain a simsense interface that lets the user experience the
^WMatrix^n in full sensory splendor, but they also have more processing power
than a warehouse of 20th-Century computers. Without a ^WCyberdeck^n, a decker is
effectively useless, making this little keyboard their most powerful weapon.
