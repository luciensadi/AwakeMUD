ASIST

Usage: ^gASIST^n

This command is used while decking to switch between hot and cold
ASIST modes on a deck with a hot ASIST component. Decks with a cold
ASIST component, or ones bought from a store cannot change their ASIST
mode. While in Cold ASIST mode you are immune to the more damaging
affects of Black IC, but you lose the ability to use your hacking pool
and response increases.

Cyberware versions of the ASIST interface are always cold ASIST.
