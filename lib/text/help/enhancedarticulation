"ENHANCED ARTICULATION"

Enchanced articulation allows the users joints to move both smoother and
further than normal. This grants a +1 reaction boost and also provides an
extra dice to any test that involves physical, technical or B/R Skills.

These bonuses do not apply towards decking or rigging and do not affect
a riggers control pool.
