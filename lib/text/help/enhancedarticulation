"ENHANCED ARTICULATION"

Enchanced articulation allows the users joints to move both smoother and
further than normal. This grants a +1 reaction boost and also provides an
extra dice to any test that involves physical, technical or Build and Repair Skills.

These bonuses do not apply towards decking or rigging and do not affect
a riggers control pool.
