                                 AwakeMUD

AwakeMUD began in the summer of 1994 as a pet project.  After a 
wonderful hard drive crash, it was started again in December of 1994.
It is based off of CircleMUD 3.0 (see below), and was started by 
Christopher J. Dickey until he gave up in early 1997. Since then, the mud
has advanced incredibly through the work of Pook and Rift.

Toward the end of 1998, Awake 2050 (The mud this codebase was built from),
lost its server due to situations that were beyond our power.  The codebase
just stuck on various hard drives and well, did nothing.  Awake was believed
by many to be dead for good.  Rift and Pook went to college, and got on with
their lives.

Fastjack and Dunkelzahn, two chummers from Awake 2050 were working on a 
secondary project called Beyond the Shadows: 2084. Dunkelzahn through Finn
met Jerkweed, who offered server space for Beyond the Shadows.  Fastjack and
Dunk accepted, and then Dunk got brave and asked if he could put a second
mud on the box.  (awake.infomatrix.org)  He was most gracious.  Dunkelzahn
did some searching to find Phrodo and Rift, who both had copies of Awake's
then dusty codebase.  By February 2nd 2000, Awake was back up and running.

Coders who have worked on this codebase after Christopher Dickey (Flynn) and 
Andrew Hynek (Rift) are as follows:  Fastjack (mostly), Demise (who's work
is documented under /doc/CHANGES.demise), Terra, Washu, Jerkweed (our host
at awake.infomatrix.org), Shadowen, Che, and Dunkelzahn *a spec change here, an
addition to a table there... I didn't actually write any code --Dunk*, and
last but definately not least, Phrodo.  (Who was also our host at one of our
old servers, the old shadowrun.org [Not affiliated in any way with the 
current owners of shadowrun.org])

Also, last but not least TONS of credit goes to the wonderful people at the
FASA corporation (yeah we know its dead now) for if it weren't for their 
creativity and ideas, Awake 2050, and its codebase, AwakeMUD would not exist.
