The year is 2064.  Mankind has advanced further in technology, but many new
things have become part of everyday life.  Probably the most evident of these
are magic, the evolution of human races, and matrix technology.  Around
2010, it became apparent that magic had returned to the world.  Science
studied it and formed a new branch since current theories could not explain
the mysteries of magic.  Around 2015, humans began to evolve into several
new races, including dwarves, elves, orks, and trolls (while others, still
a majority, remained human).  And finally, around 2030, with the advent
of simsense technology (where an implant in the brain allows you to experience
a type of virtual reality media indistinguishable from real life), the world
networks linked to form a matrix, has become navigated through a derivative
of this technology.  This has created a speed of data manipulation never
before achievable by mankind.  All this surrounded by huge corporations which
are now able to act like individual countries, governments in turmoil, and
new, deadly species (to include dracoforms), create what is life in 2064.
