The apartment gives off the scent of body odor and junk food, giving the
impression the occupant spends quite a lot of time here. Tatami mats on the
floor are a stark contrast to the dull peeling wallpaper. A desk sits against
one wall, supporting a desktop computer attached to numerous cookers of
various manufactuer.
