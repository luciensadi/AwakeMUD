A few posters for various gun manufacturers are tacked up in strategic locations
to hide cracks. Mismatched, cheap furniture is laid out around the room with
no apparent rhyme or reason, but it's all comfortable. Take out containers and
other food wrappings are stacked all over the counterspace and near the fridge.
