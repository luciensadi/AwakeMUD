   The walls of this small apartment have been lined with a wooden board
wallpaper and off-white carpeting to give it a warmer feeling. The usually
flimsy door has been replaced with a solid oak model with ^RHel^Ll Sc^ryth
^WPro^Lgram^Wming^n written on a black metal sign hanging above the peephole. The
apartment has been arranged more like an office then a home, a large desk sits
near the eastern window with a small but powerful computer buzzing quitely
atop it. Behind the desk are two shelves, the wooden one filled with a number
of phones, radios, keycards, and other random items. The metal shelf on the
other hand is lined with firearms, clips, and unassembled attachments. Over in
the north western corner sits a wooden armoire with a loveseat and easy chair
resting on either side of it along the wall. The kitchen is bare aside from a
strange black fridge with a number of post-it notes stuck all over the freezer
door explaining program codes and random computer babble. A massive "^RDO NOT
TOUCH ANYTHING ON THE FLOOR^n" sign sits along the eastern wall, in direct view
the second you walk through the door.
