The gleaming white walls and freshly vacuumed grey carpet make this small room seem much larger. A combination tub/shower stall takes up one corner next to a pair of overstuffed chairs that sit next to a chest. Across the room a shelf competes for wall space with a small black footlocker and a futon piled with blankets and pillows. Four large boxes take up the back wall. These room smells faintly of gun oil, cigarette smoke, carpet powder, and sex. Your typical shadowrunners pad.
