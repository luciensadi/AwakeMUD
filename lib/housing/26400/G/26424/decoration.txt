   Your standing in a dark, run down apartment, there are piles of cords
everywhere and various cartons of soy-food lying around. Theres an old hammock
hung in the corner and a Trid Stand, that's been converted into a computer
desk in the other one. There are a couple of band posters on the intact walls.
