   The apartment itself seems somewhat cheaply built in comparison to the rest
of the building, but it's still adequate. A single smaller room, just barely
passing as suitable for a troll sized occupant, with a small kitchen and a
bathroom attached to it. The floor has no padding, simply being a cheap green
carpet layer thrown over whatever hard surface lies underneath, and the walls
don't seem thick enough to really block out the neighbors trid should they
have it up barely past a normal volume. The bathroom has a stand-up shower,
toilet, and a sink with a small mirror/medicine cabinet. The kitchen contains
a relatively small stove, sink, several small cupboards, and a mini-fridge.
None the less this place has a couple up sides such as pirated trideo feed,
and fairly decent space for an Ork sized occupant or smaller.
