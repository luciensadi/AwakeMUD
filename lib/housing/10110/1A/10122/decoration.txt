This apartment looks gutted apart from the hammock and simple closet in the corner. The floor is covered in dirt and you have doubts to the sanity of the occupant due to the firepit in the center of the apartment, the broken open animal bones in the corner, and the sharp blood splattered rocks that litter the room.
