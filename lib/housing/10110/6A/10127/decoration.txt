You know the apartment is small, but its not like you could tell by looking at it: Tapestries make fabric walls and dividers. The main compartment is divided into two sections, a sort of sitting sleeping/futon section and a small shrine-like setup, incense burning, hookah smouldering and various dog-related fetishes, necklaces, and paintings hang from the ceiling and a half-stack marshall amplifier. The guitar sits next to the amp, it's montego black finish glinting in the neon and candle light.
