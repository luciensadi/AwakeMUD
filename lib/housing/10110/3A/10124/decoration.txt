   This apartment is somewhat cheaply built in comparison to the rest of the
building, but it's more than adequate for anybody less than troll in size. The
single small room appears to have recently been touched up. The cheap green
carpet, the standard for this building, has been replaced with nicer, properly
installed grey shag (padding and all). Like most of the other units in this
building, the walls are too thin to block out the neighbors' trid, but at
least they've recieved a fresh coat of paint.
   The kitchen has seen a little care, too. The small stove and sink are
identical to other units in the building, but some of the standard cabinets
have been removed to make room for a regular-sized fridge. The real stand out
feature of this unit is the bathroom. Instead of a stand up shower, this
apartment features a tub just large enough for a troll to enjoy a bubble bath.
The rest of the bathroom is to form for the building, with a toilet, small
sink, and mirror/medicine cabinet combo squeezed into the remaining space.
