   Your feet echo on the shiny, faux-wood floor as you enter. A mid-sized trid
screen sits against one wall, with an off-white, leather couch facing it. A
dark, oaken coffee table sits to one side. Standing lamps provide an amount of
diffuse lighting, casting the room in a light amber glow.
   An opening in one wall provides a view of the kitchen - large, but not
opulent, with roomy granite, or granite-look, benchtops. Well equipped and
with plenty of storage space. Next to the kitchen is a curtained off doorway,
leading to a bedroom.
