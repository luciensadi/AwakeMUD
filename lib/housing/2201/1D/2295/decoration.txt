   You step in through the door into a spacious living room. A large
double-window looks out over the pool area, and further out over the city of
Tacoma. The walls are painted a sandy blue color, with the occasional fantasy
theme oil painting taking up space. Off in the back corner is a black,
overstuffed leather couch, flanked on either side by a granite end-table.
Against the opposite wall from the couch is an elaborate entertainment system,
complete with old-school CD, DVD, Tri-D, and even a simsense player, though it
doesn't look like it gets much use. Candles, incense, and small braziers light
the place almost exclusively, the only electric light coming from the LED
lights of the entertainment center. Finishing off the room are a pair of black
leather recliners, each with their own table beside them.
