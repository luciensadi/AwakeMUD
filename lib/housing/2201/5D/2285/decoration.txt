   This room would seem very simple if not for the dazzling, and expensive
looking pieces of furniture placed in a fashionably strategic manner. A
leather couch here, a dark translucent table and to top it all off a fireplace
embedded into the wall. On closer examination you notice that the fireplace
has an avant garde look to it, curved out into a quarter dome. Magazines are
strewn about, and a medium sized television set rests on the floor.
