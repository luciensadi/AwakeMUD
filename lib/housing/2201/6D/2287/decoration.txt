   Passing through the 5 inch thick solid steel door you enter the main living
area. Dark hardwood floors cover the floor, the greyish black wallpaper
covered in a variety of what look like old war metals and a few paper targets
with massive holes blown in key locations on the featureless enemies printed
on them. A black leather sofa sits near the eastern wall, a trid screen and
coffee table infront of it for his entertainment. A single deep blue recliner
is off to the right of the sofa a bit, a collection of empty beer bottles
laying beside it. Off to the left, partitioned by a 10 foot long wall with a
hole cut in the middle is the kitchen. A rather ordinary looking black metal
refridgerator sits next to the stove and microwave along the southern wall. A
sink and white marble topped oak counters line the eastern part of the
kitchen, an assortment of krill bars, rations, and canteens of water stored
neatly in a small cabinet above the sink.
