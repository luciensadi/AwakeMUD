   A fairly clean apartment, the walls have been scrubbed down, and the holes
in the walls have been patched. The carpet has been ripped up and floorboards,
clean but not shiny, deck the room. The furniture is of a reasonable quality,
not too shabby, but nothing expensive.
    The futon, the only sleeping area in the room, is clean and looks new. The
kitchen area, likewise, has been scrubbed down til the tiles sparkle.
