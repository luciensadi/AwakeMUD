   This is your humble abode, with the wallpaper peeling off and random holes
through the plaster walls. The shag carpet smells of something rotten and the
furniture has springs sticking out from the cushions. Your bed is a single,
amazingly, unsoiled futon flopped in the corner of the tiny room. Home sweet
home.
