This old garage shows signs of renovation. There are a few basic furnishing
here and there. A large hermetic circle stands out from the otherwise mundane
things. Japanese charms have been placed across the room, giving it an eerie
feeling. A large bookshelf with old tomes decorates the right corner, with a
comfortable chair near it.
